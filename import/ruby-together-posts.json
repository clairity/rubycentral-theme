On top of those companies, 4 new developers signed. In total, we were supported by 96 individual members and 68 friends of Ruby Together. Thanks to all of our members for making everything that we do possible. &lt;3</p>\\n\\n<p>This semester, Ruby Together developer <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/segiddins\\\">Samuel Giddins</a> finished his studies and graduated from college! 🎉 He’ll be moving from Chicago to San Francisco, and continuing to work on both Bundler and RubyGems. Go tweet some congratulations at him.</p>\\n\\n<p>At RubyConf 2017, André gave a completely new talk about the history of Bundler, called A History of Bundles: 2010 to 2017. You can <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXFYjO8qDxk\\\">watch the video from the conference</a>, <a href=\\\"https://speakerdeck.com/indirect/a-history-of-bundles-2010-to-2017\\\">check out the slide deck</a>, or <a href=\\\"http://andre.arko.net/2017/11/16/a-history-of-bundles/\\\">read the blog post version of the talk</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>Finally, some board member news: founding board members Terence Lee and Sarah Mei have stepped down. We’re incredibly greatful to have had their help and support for almost three years. &lt;3</p>\\n\\n<p>As usual, the board will appoint successors to each vacant seat, to fill them until the next regularly scheduled board election. So far, the board has appointed one new director: <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/valeriecodes\\\">Valerie Woolard Srinivasan</a>.

It is now extremely fast to run <code>install</code> when nothing needs to be done. In addition, <a href=\\\"https://github.com/greysteil\\\">Gray Baker</a> of <a href=\\\"https://dependabot.com\\\">Dependabot</a> helped us ship some nice resolver improvements, pulling off the extremely rare victory of making the resolver more correct and faster at the same time.</p>\\n\\n<p>Since the release of 1.16 at the end of October, we’ve fixed several new bugs that have cropped up, and we expect to release version 1.16.1 sometime this week. We also expect to ship 1.16.1 in the Ruby 2.5 rc1 release shortly.</p>\\n\\n<p>Overall, Bundler gained 215 new commits, contributed by 30 authors.

There were 29 additions and 0 deletions across 6 files.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"rubygems-news\\\">rubygems news</h2>\\n\\n<p>In October and November, we released RubyGems version 2.6.14, 2.7.0, 2.7.1, 2.7.2, and 2.7.3. Those versions included some fixes backported from ruby-trunk, work to improve compatibility with Ruby 2.5, and upgrades for the version of Bundler included inside RubyGems, as well as a smattering of other bugfixes.</p>\\n\\n<p>On the topic of developing RubyGems, our very own <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/duckinator\\\">@duckinator</a> shipped <a href=\\\"https://github.com/duckinator/rgdev#readme\\\">rgdev</a>, a complete Docker-based environment for developing RubyGems.

That said, if you’re interested in contributing to an open source project, the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/bundler/gemstash/issues\\\">Gemstash issues list</a> has some promising-looking tickets.

This will be wired to a webhook so merged catalog PRs will immediately show up on  the site.</p>\\n\\n<p>Further, I got the actual, <a href=\\\"https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/pull/10\\\">new rails app started</a>, which involved getting CI running on Travis and <a href=\\\"https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/pull/17\\\">setting up deployment and continuous delivery to Heroku</a>, who will be sponsoring hosting for the Toolbox - thanks a lot Heroku! I added <a href=\\\"https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/pull/16\\\">basic category overview and detail UI</a>, also <a href=\\\"https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/pull/20\\\">making it a bit prettier along the way</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>The last missing piece needed to get the site back live is fetching the most basic stats and scoring for categorized projects from Rubygems and Github. I expect this to be done in early december. Until then, you can always see the current state of development at <a href=\\\"https://beta.ruby-toolbox.com\\\">beta.ruby-toolbox.com</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>Once the site is back live with the bare minimum set of features, the next things to bring back will be:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n  <li>Getting all rubygems back to the site (not only the categorized ones)</li>\\n  <li>Search</li>\\n  <li>Adding more metrics to bring them on par with the old site</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>Please feel warmly invited to join <a href=\\\"https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox\\\">github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox</a> and see you next month!</p>\\n\\n<p>— <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/thedeadserious\\\">Christoph</a></p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"budget-amp-expenses\\\">budget &amp; expenses</h2>\\n\\n<p>In October, we paid for 103.9 hours of developer time, saw $21,700 total income and spent a total of\\n$19,839.25.</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n  <li>$7,398.75 for 49.3 hours worked on Bundler at $150/hour</li>\\n  <li>$3,000 for 20.0 hours worked on RubyGems.org at $150/hour</li>\\n  <li>$3,426.25 for 22.8 hours worked on RubyGems at $150/hour</li>\\n  <li>$1,762.50 for 11.8 hours worked on other OSS and devtools at $150/hour</li>\\n  <li>$79.09 on dedicated servers for RubyBench.org</li>\\n  <li>$707.21 on payment processing fees</li>\\n  <li>$2,268.05 on company overhead like hosting, services, software, hardware, taxes, etc</li>\\n  <li>$570 on accounting, copywriting, design, and other professional services</li>\\n  <li>$627.40 on marketing, evangelism, and community outreach</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>In November, we paid for 60.7 hours of developer time, saw $21,545 in total income, and spent a total of $12,234.08.</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n  <li>$4,260 for 28.4 hours worked on Bundler at $150/hour</li>\\n  <li>$352.50 for 2.4 hours worked on RubyGems.org at $150/hour</li>\\n  <li>$2,528.75 for 16.9 hours worked on RubyGems at $150/hour</li>\\n  <li>$1,946.25 for 13.0 hours worked on other OSS and devtools at $150/hour</li>\\n  <li>$78.17 on dedicated servers for RubyBench.org</li>\\n  <li>$700.91 on payment processing fees</li>\\n  <li>$1,370.24 on company overhead like hosting, services, software, hardware, taxes, etc</li>\\n  <li>$320 on accounting, copywriting, design, and other professional services</li>\\n  <li>$677.26 on marketing, evangelism, and community outreach</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>Keep an eye out for Ruby 2.5, which is currently scheduled to be released on Christmas Day!

Along with @segiddins finishing off the last of his full-time summer hours, @arbonap continued to localize docs into Spanish, including automated tests for the Spanish documentation.</p>\\n\\n<p>We released the 1.16 prerelease, discovered some bugs, fixed them, and <a href=\\\"https://github.com/bundler/bundler/pull/6031\\\">removed the message asking users to upgrade to prerelease versions</a>. We’re expecting a final 1.16 release sometime this month, since the latest prerelease is looking pretty stable.</p>\\n\\n<p>After that, we’ll be starting on the path to 2.0: updating documentation, writing blog posts, testing the upgrade path, and more. Most of all, we’ll be making sure that Bundler 1.x and 2.x can coexist peacefully, so that no one is forced to upgrade or downgrade because of the projects they work on.</p>\\n\\n<p>This month, Bundler gained 104 new commits, contributed by 14 authors.

The security issue was a big one, and potentially allowed any attacker to do anything they wanted to the RubyGems.org servers.</p>\\n\\n<p>After adding fixes just to the RubyGems.org server, the combined RubyGems and RubyGems.org teams ultimately decided to patch RubyGems itself to ensure that this kind of issue can’t happen on other computers that use RubyGems, or other servers. For more information, check out <a href=\\\"http://blog.rubygems.org/2017/10/09/unsafe-object-deserialization-vulnerability.html\\\">the RubyGems blog post about the security issue and its impact</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>This month, Rubygems.org gained 4 new commits, contributed by 3 authors.

As a result of @hsbt’s heroic work, Bundler has been merged into the version of RubyGems that ships with Ruby itself! Now we’ll need to keep changes in sync between all three of ruby-core trunk, the RubyGems master branch, and the Bundler master branch. Oh boy. 😬</p>\\n\\n<p>On the bright side, you can already check out the fruits of all these teams’ labor in <a href=\\\"https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2017/10/10/ruby-2-5-0-preview1-released/\\\">Ruby 2.5-preview1</a>.

In total, we were supported by 105 individual members and 72 friends of Ruby Together. Thanks to all of our members for making everything that we do possible. &lt;3</p>\\n\\n<p>In Ruby Together news, we successfully wrapped up a summer of full-time work from <a href=\\\"https://github.com/segiddins\\\">@segiddins</a>. His three months included a huge amount of extremely productive work, including:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n  <li>addressing several RubyGems security reports</li>\\n  <li>a RubyGems security release</li>\\n  <li>code to allow RubyGems to (optionally) release with Bundler built in</li>\\n  <li>two Bundler 1.16 preview releases</li>\\n  <li>addressing every outstanding blocker for <a href=\\\"https://github.com/bundler/bundler/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%222.0+—+Breaking+Changes%22+is%3Aclosed\\\">the Bundler 2.0 github milestone</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>On a slightly sadder note, founding board member <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/steveklabnik\\\">Steve Klabnik</a> has stepped down from the board of directors. The remaining directors will appoint an interim director to serve out the rest of Steve’s term, and we will have a board election soon. We’re incredibly grateful to Steve for his support in getting Ruby Together off the ground, and we wish him the best as he focuses on Rust! ❤️</p>\\n\\n<p>Finally, the multiply-teased secret announcement is finally coming together, and we’ll be sharing details about it in the next update!</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"bundler-news\\\">bundler news</h2>\\n\\n<p>Building on the fantastic work done by Sam over the summer, RubyGems and ruby-core team member <a href=\\\"https://github.com/hsbt\\\">@hsbt</a> spent countless hours to get the Bundler test suite passing inside the overall Ruby language test suite. As a result of that work, <a href=\\\"https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/12733#note-14\\\">Matz approved shipping Bundler with RubyGems, inside Ruby</a>. Bundler was merged into the Ruby standard library in <a href=\\\"https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/projects/ruby-trunk/repository/revisions/59779\\\">revision 59780</a>, and is expected to ship with Ruby 2.5. Thank you for all your help and hard work, hsbt! 🙇</p>\\n\\n<p>Contributor <a href=\\\"https://github.com/arbonap\\\">@arbonap</a> began <a href=\\\"https://github.com/bundler/bundler-site/pull/328\\\">translating the Bundler website into Spanish</a>, and has been enthusiastically assisted by several Spanish-speaking contributors. 💜</p>\\n\\n<p>The work on Bundler last month was focused on changes for 2.0—we have finished adding feature flags for every change, and the difference between Bundler 1.x and Bundler 2.0 will be the default values for those settings! Bundler core team member <a href=\\\"https://github.com/colby-swandale\\\">Colby Swandale</a> gave a talk at <a href=\\\"http://rubykaigi.org/2017\\\">RubyKaigi</a> about Bundler 2, and the Bundler team has kicked off the process of shipping the 2.0 release.</p>\\n\\n<p>That means we’ll be spending at least a few weeks, and possibly a few months, testing workflows, updating documentation, writing blog posts, and working with users to ensure that the transition will be as smooth as possible. If you’re interested in trying it out and helping us improve the upgrade process, we would love to hear from you in <a href=\\\"https://slackin.bundler.io\\\">the Bundler Slack</a>!</p>\\n\\n<p>This month, Bundler gained 144 new commits, contributed by 15 authors. There were 2,395 additions and 730 deletions across 154 files.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"rubygemsorg-news\\\">rubygems.org news</h2>\\n\\n<p>To help Bundler and RubyGems users connect to RubyGems.org in the future, <a href=\\\"https://github.com/indirect\\\">@indirect</a> and <a href=\\\"https://github.com/rubymorillo\\\">@rubymorillo</a> worked together to <a href=\\\"https://github.com/bundler/bundler-site/pull/324\\\">expand the SSL troubleshooting guide</a>. We’d love to get your feedback on <a href=\\\"https://github.com/bundler/bundler-site/blob/067698ae7b77a2769653315799f8741d74c73d52/source/v1.15/guides/rubygems_tls_ssl_troubleshooting_guide.html.md\\\">the work-in-progress guide</a>, so check it out!</p>\\n\\n<p>RubyGems.org saw ongoing maintenance, including gem upgrades, server upgrades, and other small improvements, as well as work on the database servers. In August, the RubyGems.org repo gained 15 commits, contributed by 7 authors. There were 52 additions and 57 deletions across 11 files.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"rubygems-news\\\">rubygems news</h2>\\n\\n<p>RubyGems saw ongoing maintenance and bugfixes, as well as patches for several security issues, included in the <a href=\\\"http://blog.rubygems.org/2017/08/27/2.6.13-released.html\\\">security release of version 2.6.13</a>. If you’re unable to upgrade to the latest RubyGems, check out <a href=\\\"https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2017/08/29/multiple-vulnerabilities-in-rubygems/\\\">the backport patches for Ruby 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4</a>. In total, Rubygems gained 57 new commits, contributed by 11 authors. There were 978 additions and 302 deletions across 38 files.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"gemstash-news\\\">gemstash news</h2>\\n\\n<p>On August 21, Google Cloud Platform announced <a href=\\\"https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-gemserver\\\">google-cloud-gemserver</a>, a new gem from a summer intern to make running Gemstash on GCP as easy as running Gemstash on your local machine, which is super cool! You can read more about it <a href=\\\"https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2017/08/rolling-your-own-private-Ruby-gem-server-on-Google-Cloud-Platform.html\\\">in the announcement blog post</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>Unfortunately, when the project was announced, I (André) jumped to conclusions and <a href=\\\"https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-gemserver/issues/36\\\">accused the project of violating Gemstash’s MIT license</a>. My post was unreasonably aggressive, and I shouldn’t have posted it, even if I had been right… which I wasn’t. I turned out to be completely wrong, and <a href=\\\"https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-gemserver/issues/36#issuecomment-324503159\\\">apologized to the author</a> a few hours later.</p>\\n\\n<p>Sorry for letting you down, everyone. 💔 I’ll try to be much more careful, and more gentle, in the future.</p>\\n\\n<p>Gemstash itself saw regular ongoing maintenance: the unyank command was removed, to mirror rubygems.org, and the tests were updated to run against the latest JRuby version. This month, Gemstash gained 19 new commits, contributed by 2 authors. There were 22 additions and 381 deletions across 20 files.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"budget-amp-expenses\\\">budget &amp; expenses</h2>\\n\\n<p>In August, we saw $19,140 in total income, and spent a total of $26,217.61.</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n  <li>$13,821 for 92.1 hours worked on Bundler at $150/hour</li>\\n  <li>$4,774 for 31.8 hours worked on RubyGems.org at $150/hour</li>\\n  <li>$446 for 3.0 hours worked on RubyGems at $150/hour</li>\\n  <li>$1,871 for 12.5 hours worked on other OSS and devtools at $150/hour</li>\\n  <li>$78.97 on dedicated servers for RubyBench.org</li>\\n  <li>$638.86 on payment processing fees</li>\\n  <li>$1,986.12 on company overhead like hosting, services, software, hardware, taxes, etc</li>\\n  <li>$1,287.50 on accounting, copywriting, design, and other professional services</li>\\n  <li>$1,313.66 on marketing, evangelism, and community outreach</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>Until next time,<br />\\nAndré and the Ruby Together team</p>\\n\\n\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}"},{"title":"May and June 2017 Monthly Update","status":"published","published_at":1499212800,"mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"html\",{\"cardName\":\"html\",\"html\":\"\\n\\n<p>Hello! Welcome to the monthly update. During May and June, we paid for 179.4 hours of developer work on Bundler, RubyGems, and other open source tools. Our work was supported by <a href=\\\"http://stripe.com/\\\">Stripe</a>, <a href=\\\"https://basecamp.com/\\\">Basecamp</a>, <a href=\\\"http://icelab.com.au/\\\">Icelab</a>, <a href=\\\"http://gitlab.com/\\\">Gitlab</a>, <a href=\\\"http://cloudcity.io\\\">Cloud City</a>, and many others.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"ruby-together-news\\\">ruby together news</h2>\\n\\n<p>In May and June, Ruby Together was supported by 81 different companies, including Sapphire member <a href=\\\"https://stripe.com\\\">Stripe</a>. 3 companies joined as new members, including <a href=\\\"https://dayoftheshirt.com\\\">Day of the Shirt</a> and <a href=\\\"http://www.clickfunnels.com\\\">ClickFunnels</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>On top of those companies, 6 new developers signed up as members or friends of Ruby Together, including Josh Cass, Mark Tareshawty, Anıl İyidoğan, Dian Pan, and Sangwon Yi. In total, we were supported by 113 individual members and 73 friends of Ruby Together. Thanks to all of our members for making everything that we do possible. &lt;3</p>\\n\\n<p>In company news, we’ve brought <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/therubyrep\\\">@therubyrep</a> onboard to help with admininstration work, including compiling these updates! We’re expecting to be more timely in the future as a result of her help.</p>\\n\\n<p>For project work, we have three announcements: The indomitable <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/segiddins\\\">@segiddins</a> has agreed to work on Bundler and RubyGems full time over the summer, and we’ve already seen that start to pay off in the form of countless Bundler PRs working towards Bundler 2.</p>\\n\\n<p>Next, <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/radiomorillo\\\">@radiomorillo</a> has joined us to help us craft a RubyGems.org SSL troubleshooting guide. Historically, we’ve seen many users report problems with SSL certificates, depending on their exact OS, OpenSSL installation, Ruby version, and other factors besides. In the future, we’re expecting many new issue reports when RubyGems.org deprecates versions of TLS older than 1.2. Hopefully, we’ll come up with a guide that can help everyone get their issues sorted out and get back to installing gems.</p>\\n\\n<p>Finally, we’ve also asked <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/patricia_arbona\\\">@parbona</a> to help us review and revise Bundler’s website and documentation with an eye towards helping and supporting new users and contributors. In the future, we’d love to get the documentation to a point where new developers can use the Bunlder docs to get started, rather than (usually) needing to be led through the process with explanations from more experienced developers.</p>\\n\\n<p>The secret announcement we teased last time isn’t quite ready yet, but we think you’ll be pleased once you hear it. Keep holding on, and we’ll get there!</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"bundler-news\\\">bundler news</h2>\\n\\n<p>In May and June, Bundler saw the release of 1.15 final, and the 1.15.1 bugfix release. The biggest changes in Bundler were: a huge speedup to <code>bundle exec</code> on large gemfiles, a new <code>bundle issue</code> command, a new <code>bundle add</code> command, and a new <code>bundle pristine</code> command. We also (finally) shipped man pages for every Bundler command that currently exists, and plan to maintain full manpage coverage for all future releases. If you’re interested in those changes, you can read more in <a href=\\\"http://bundler.io/blog/2017/05/19/bundler-1-15-bundle-oh-so-fast.html\\\">the Bundler 1.15 release announcement</a>, or just upgrade right away by running <code>gem install bundler</code>.</p>\\n\\n<p>Along with the 1.15 release, we kicked off a realistic plan towards releasing Bundler 2.0. Rather than forking into two codebases, we are implementing all of our planned changes for 2.0 as feature flags, disabled by default. Anyone interested can try out all of the changes that we’ve finished implementing so far by setting the relevant feature flags. Once everything is complete, we’ll be able to release a 2.0 with the new default settings, and it’s shaping up to be really great so far. It’s incredibly exciting to see (literally) years of planning pay off.</p>\\n\\n<p>In total, Bundler gained 248 new commits, contributed by 20 authors. There were 7,861 additions and 1,991 deletions across 920 files.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"rubygemsorg-news\\\">rubygems.org news</h2>\\n\\n<p>RubyGems.org saw a new <a href=\\\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/pull/1603\\\">advanced search page</a>, updates to Rails and many other gems, and fixes to various and sundry bugs, including validations for email length, session expiration, and visual bugs on the 404 page.</p>\\n\\n<p>Overall, Rubygems.org gained 88 new commits, contributed by 9 authors. There were 1,375 additions and 764 deletions across 246 files.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"rubygems-news\\\">rubygems news</h2>\\n\\n<p>The RubyGems library also got some love, seeing new <code>signin</code> and <code>signout</code> commands for explicit authorization to RubyGems.org. There were also performance improvements and bugfixes from @segiddins. Rubygems gained 43 new commits, contributed by 11 authors. There were 365 additions and 112 deletions across 28 files.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"gemstash-news\\\">gemstash news</h2>\\n\\n<p>Gemstash gained a new comprehensive health check, allowing automated systems to see whether a given Gemstash server is able to respond, reach the file storage, and reach the database.

In total, we were supported by 115 individual members and 76 friends of Ruby Together. Thanks to all of our members for making everything that we do possible. &lt;3</p>\\n\\n<p>April saw us continue to move forward with plans for funding additional Ruby projects. We can’t announce it just yet, but <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/rubytogether\\\">follow us on twitter</a> or read next month’s newsletter for what will hopefully be an exciting announcement.</p>\\n\\n<p>Some other plans moved forward as well, and we launched our <a href=\\\"https://github.com/rubytogether/feedback\\\">public feedback forum</a>. Since the beginning, Ruby and RubyGems have been maintained and advanced by a small group of passionate volunteers. We have all of them to thank for the large, vibrant community that exists today. However, Ruby has matured to the point where its supporting infrastructure is both vital to the larger internet economy, and can no longer be maintained by a few volunteers.</p>\\n\\n<p>We created Ruby Together to allow Ruby devs and companies to collectively pay developers for their time and effort working on central and critical projects. That said, our primary goal is to to serve and improve the entire Ruby community.</p>\\n\\n<p>To help us do that more effectively, we’re creating this repo as a collaborative forum where anyone who is passionate about Ruby open source and infrastructure can share and discuss their ideas, opinions, and concerns with each other and with the Ruby Together team. Membership is Ruby Together is not required to participate or give feedback, and all feedback will be read and considered as we decide how to best support the Ruby community in the future. Come by and <a href=\\\"https://github.com/rubytogether/feedback/issues\\\">tell us how you think we’re doing</a>!</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"bundler-news\\\">bundler news</h2>\\n\\n<p>Last month, we started pushing prereleases of Bundler 1.15. As of today, we’re up to version 1.15.0.pre.4, and it’s looking increasingly likely that the next version will be the release candidate. Highlight features for 1.15 include man pages for all commands (thanks, @feministy!), a <code>bundle issue</code> command to help users report problems (thanks, @jonathanpike!), and a <code>bundle add</code> command (thanks, @denniss!).</p>\\n\\n<p>On top of those changes, version 1.15 will also include dramatically improved performance when loading Bundler in applications with hundreds of gems, and the huge improvement to error messages when a matching version can’t be found that we mentioned in <a href=\\\"https://rubytogether.org/news/2017-04-18-march-2017-monthly-update\\\">our last monthly update</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>Many other bugs were fixed, and additional smaller features have been added. Check out <a href=\\\"https://github.com/bundler/bundler/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\\\">the Bundler changelog</a> for the full details. In total, this month 13 authors pushed 149 commits, including 1,668 additions and 306 deletions across 78 files.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"rubygemsorg-news\\\">rubygems.org news</h2>\\n\\n<p>The biggest event for RubyGems.org this month was <a href=\\\"https://www.fastly.com/blog/phase-two-our-tls-10-and-11-deprecation-plan/\\\">Fastly’s planned deprecation of TLS 1.0 and 1.1</a>. We didn’t realize it beforehand, but many, many developers and servers are still using Ruby without support for TLS 1.2. We were surprised because support for TLS 1.2 was added to OpenSSL <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSSL#Major_version_releases\\\">in version 1.0.1 on March 14, 2012</a>, over five years ago! In a group effort, we were able to work together with <a href=\\\"http://rubycentral.org\\\">Ruby Central</a> and <a href=\\\"https://www.fastly.com\\\">Fastly</a> to quickly add back support for the older TLS 1.0 and 1.1.</p>\\n\\n<p>Unfortunately, the PCI Security Standards Council’s requirements mean that Fastly will be disabling TLS 1.0 and 1.1 for all users, including RubyGems.org, at the end of April 2018. This month, we started working on an early warning system that will inform Ruby developers if they need to upgrade, and we will roll it out later this year to make sure that everyone has plenty of time to adjust before the older versions of TLS are disabled again.</p>\\n\\n<p>In total, RubyGems.org gained 21 new commits, with 4 different contributors changing 63 files. There were 851 additions and 305 deletions.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"rubygems-news\\\">rubygems news</h2>\\n\\n<p>For RubyGems, April saw the release of version 2.6.12. Fixes include installing gems on MinGW systems, the <code>gem open</code> command once again opening the newest version of a gem by default, and generating binstubs (like the file named <code>rake</code>, used to run rake commands) that will work with both current and older versions of RubyGems. In total, RubyGems saw 17 new commits from 6 different contributors. They changed 16 files, with 162 additions and 61 deletions.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"gemstash-news\\\">gemstash news</h2>\\n\\n<p>Gemstash didn’t see any major changes during April, but it’s still a solid option if you need to host your own private gems or set up a local cache for RubyGems.org on your machine, in your office, or in your datacenter. In total, Gemstash gained 3 new commits. 2 different authors changed 5 files, with 37 additions and 6 deletions.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"budget--expenses\\\">budget &amp; expenses</h2>\\n\\n<p>In April, we saw $22,252 in total income, and spent a total of $9,479.49.</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n  <li>$1,950 for 13.0 hours worked on Bundler at $150/hour</li>\\n  <li>$1,538 for 10.3 hours worked on RubyGems.org at $150/hour</li>\\n  <li>$975 for 6.5 hours worked on RubyGems at $150/hour</li>\\n  <li>$1,388 for 9.3 hours worked on other OSS and devtools at $150/hour</li>\\n  <li>$71.77 on dedicated servers for RubyBench.org</li>\\n  <li>$732.52 on payment processing fees</li>\\n  <li>$1,166.63 on company overhead like hosting, services, software, hardware, taxes, etc</li>\\n  <li>$150.0 on accounting, copywriting, design, and other professional services</li>\\n  <li>$1,508.57 on marketing, evangelism, and community outreach</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>Until next time,<br />\\nAndré and the Ruby Together team</p>\\n\\n\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}"},{"title":"March 2017 Monthly Update","status":"published","published_at":1492473600,"mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"html\",{\"cardName\":\"html\",\"html\":\"\\n\\n<p>Hello!

Thanks to all of our members for making everything that we do possible. &lt;3</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"bundler-news\\\">bundler news</h2>\\n\\n<p>During March, we fixed bugs and started merging new features for Bundler 1.15. The most exciting change is a much clearer explanation when a Gemfile cannot be resolved.</p>\\n\\n<p>Previously, any requirement for a failed gem would be printed out. That meant the error message would include things like “Could not resolve requirement <code>rack ~&gt; 10.1</code>, Gemfile contained <code>rack 10.2</code>”. Since Rack version 10.2 is allowed by that requirement, it was not helpful to include it in the error message. Error messages when resolution fails in the future will be much easier to understand, since they will only include the requirements that could not be met.</p>\\n\\n<p>A host of additional small features and fixes were added as well.

Welcome to the monthly update—or in this particular case, two monthly updates. During the months of January and February, our work was supported by <a href=\\\"http://stripe.com/\\\">Stripe</a>, <a href=\\\"http://www.codeminer42.com/\\\">CodeMiner42</a>, <a href=\\\"http://www.digitalocean.com/\\\" title=\\\"DigitalOcean\\\">DigitalOcean</a>, <a href=\\\"https://travis-ci.org/\\\" title=\\\"Travis CI\\\">Travis CI</a>, <a href=\\\"https://thoughtbot.com/\\\" title=\\\"thoughtbot\\\">thoughtbot</a>, and many, many others.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"ruby-together-news\\\">ruby together news</h2>\\n\\n<p>In some ways, January and February were boring and run-of-the-mill: we paid developers to work on open source, and Ruby OSS infrastructure was maintained and improved. We were supported by 84 companies, including <a href=\\\"http://travis-ci.com\\\">Travis</a>, <a href=\\\"http://www.airbnb.com\\\">Airbnb</a>, and <a href=\\\"http://gitlab.com\\\">GitLab</a> all renewing their memberships for the entire year of 2017. 13 companies joined as new members, including <a href=\\\"https://evilmartians.com\\\">Evil Martians</a>, <a href=\\\"https://makandra.com\\\">makandra</a>, <a href=\\\"http://substancelab.com\\\">Substance Lab</a>, <a href=\\\"https://instrumentalapp.com\\\">Instrumental</a>, <a href=\\\"https://buildkite.com\\\">Buildkite</a>, <a href=\\\"https://docraptor.com\\\">DocRaptor</a>, <a href=\\\"http://www.evolvingmedia.net/\\\">Evolving Media Network / Moonfarmer</a>, <a href=\\\"https://newington.nsw.edu.au\\\">Newington College</a>, <a href=\\\"http://www.makemusic.com/\\\">MAKEMUSIC</a>, and <a href=\\\"https://github.com/benlovellltd\\\">Ben Lovell Ltd</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>On top of those companies, 42 developers signed up as friends of Ruby Together, and 18 developers signed up as members, including Jon Atack, Eric Henderson, Nichol Alexander, Bess Sadler, Daniel Fone, Spencer Roach, Jeff Sandberg, Ivan Stana, Piotr Szmielew, Daniel Leavitt, Andrei Beliankou, Matthew Werner, Eliot Sykes, and Richard Harrah. In total, we were supported by over 180 individual members and 88 friends of Ruby Together. Thanks to all of our members for making everything that we do possible. &lt;3</p>\\n\\n<p>In some other ways, though, these months were surprisingly eventful: the Ruby Together board was approached in private by a group of concerned developers. The feedback those developers gave broke down into three categories. First, the Bundler post-install message was unfortunately misleading some people into thinking that Ruby Together pays for the RubyGems.org servers, when that is not the case. Second, they were concerned that Ruby Together could be seen as a way for André and the other funded maintainers to blackmail companies into paying Ruby Together for features or bugfixes. Finally, the group said they also felt upset there was no official avenue to accept their feedback to Ruby Together.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Ruby Together board listened to their feedback, and will be addressing all three points. To start with, the Bundler team has removed the Bundler post-install message until they can come up with a clearer one. The Bundler readme has also been revised to clarify what Ruby Together pays for, and make it clear that feature requests will always be evaluated on their own merits, not based on whether the person or company proposing the feature is a member.</p>\\n\\n<p>Towards addressing the second point, we have started work on an official project funding policy. The policy will make our criteria for funding projects public, as well as detailing the mechanisms we employ to separate recipients of funds from decisions about funding them. Keep an eye out for that policy in a separate announcement in the coming weeks.</p>\\n\\n<p>Finally, in order to help Ruby Together accomplish its goal of serving the entire community, we will be establishing a public feedback group just for Ruby Together. We will use that forum to open discussion of policy and funding issues, and especially to get feedback on proposed plans before they are implemented. Participation will be open to anyone who uses Ruby, not just members. Our work is for the whole community, and we want to hear from all of them.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"bundler-news\\\">bundler news</h2>\\n\\n<p>The exciting news for Bundler in this update is a feature release: 1.14. Version 1.14 validates downloaded .gem files against checksums provided by RubyGems.org, it improves support for running a single bundled application on more than one OS, and shows dramatically more information if the Ruby or RubyGems version conflicts with gem requirements.</p>\\n\\n<p>After releasing 1.14 final, we continued to fix reported bugs, including a small number of regressions. Between Dec 29 and Feb 22, we pushed 5 bugfix releaseso fixing many reported issues and repairing compatibility with the upcoming Ruby 2.5 release. In total, Bundler merged 106 pull requests that included 152 commits. 24 different contributors changed 266 files, with 3,135 additions and 1,066 deletions.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"rubygemsorg-news\\\">rubygems.org news</h2>\\n\\n<p>Over on RubyGems.org, changing your email address got more reliable: we now require verification of your new email address before removing your old one. Along with the usual security updates, we also dramatically improved the performance of the inverse dependencies API. In total, RubyGems.org merged 3 pull requests including 89 commits. 12 different contributors changed 95 files, with 2,477 additions and 1,838 deletions.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"rubygems-news\\\">rubygems news</h2>\\n\\n<p>There were two bugfix releases of RubyGems, version 2.6.9 and 2.6.10, fixing six miscellaneous bugs and updating the dependency resolver shared with Bundler and CocoaPods. In total, RubyGems merged 33 pull requests that included 33 commits, and 9 contributors changed 40 files, with 569 additions and 158 deletions.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"gemstash-news\\\">gemstash news</h2>\\n\\n<p>Gemstash released version 1.0.4, adding private gem support for the <code>latest_gems</code> endpoint used by <code>gem install</code>.

Six new developers signed up to support our work as Friends of Ruby Together. On top of that, ten more developers joined as members, including Nishant Modak, Thom May, Jack Bracewell, George Millo, Karlotcha Hoa, Stanislav Katkov, Chris Holmes. In addition, five completely new companies added their support: <a href=\\\"https://www.chef.io/\\\">Chef</a>, <a href=\\\"http://www.unboxed.co/\\\">Unboxed</a>, <a href=\\\"http://carbonfive.com/\\\">Carbon Five</a>, <a href=\\\"https://teezily.com/\\\">Teezily</a>, and <a href=\\\"http://www.intellum.com/\\\">Intellum</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>Thanks to all of our members for making everything that we do possible. &lt;3</p>\\n\\n<p>In exciting news for the upcoming year, our team gained an Empress of Documentation: <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/feministy\\\">Liz Abinante</a>. We’re super excited to have a mastermind behind making Bundler and RubyGems more understandable and accessible for new users.</p>\\n\\n<p>On the board of directors, we saw <a href=\\\"http://twitter.com/randommood\\\">Ines Sombra</a> step down from her position. Ines has been a fantastic and incredibly helpful board member, and we’re super grateful to have had her input. Thanks for everything, Ines. &lt;3</p>\\n\\n<p>The remaining members of the board nominated <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/camille_\\\">Camille Baldock</a> to fill the newly empty seat, and she graciously accepted. Camille participated in this year’s board election, coming in just one or two votes behind the other candidates. We’re incredibly glad to have another chance to work with Camille, and are looking forward to getting even more done in 2017.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"bundler-news\\\">bundler news</h2>\\n\\n<p>December was a good month for Bundler. We released one bugfix release, <code>1.13.7</code>, and we released a preview of the next version of Bundler, version <code>1.14.0.pre.1</code>. 13 contributors created 99 commits, and changed 63 files with 783 additions and 193 deletions.</p>\\n\\n<p>Bundler 1.14 includes a huge number of bugfixes and small additional features, mostly focused on improving how well existing commands work. Support for different operating systems and platforms is improved, Ruby 2.5 (compiled from source control) is supported, and a notable error caused by an invalid lock file is now handled automatically. For a full list of improvements, <a href=\\\"https://github.com/bundler/bundler/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1140pre1-2016-12-29\\\">check out the changelog</a>.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"rubygemsorg-news\\\">rubygems.org news</h2>\\n\\n<p>The RubyGems.org service was given the usual security updates this month, and saw a couple of useful fixes. Changing email addresses now requires confirmation before activation, so users can’t lock themselves out with a typo. 9 contributors created 47 commits, changing 59 files with 565 additions and 202 deletions.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"rubygems-news\\\">rubygems news</h2>\\n\\n<p>RubyGems continued to gain ground on the backlog of bugs and issues. The most notable changes were speed improvements for <code>require 'rubygems'</code>, and a fix for hash collisions when comparing objects. 4 contributors created 16 commits, changing 11 files with 88 additions and 48 deletions.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"gemstash-news\\\">gemstash news</h2>\\n\\n<p>Gemstash wasn’t super busy, but still gained some features: it is now possible to set arbitrary Sequel connection options, and the connection pool now defaults to the same size as the number of running Puma threads. In total, 2 contributors made 8 commits, changing 7 files with 41 additions and 6 deletions.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"budget--expenses\\\">budget &amp; expenses</h2>\\n\\n<p>From November 20 to December 19, Ruby Together took in $22,620.

The <a href=\\\"https://github.com/how-is/how_is\\\">how_is</a> tool got another <a href=\\\"https://github.com/how-is/how_is/blob/v11.0.0/CHANGELOG.md#1100\\\">release</a>, and will soon be used to actively <a href=\\\"https://how-is.github.io/how-is-rubygems/2016/12/01/report.html\\\">appraise the status</a> of our various projects.</p>\\n\\n<p>We also created a <a href=\\\"https://github.com/rubytogether/rubytogether-lita/blob/84f6bec5d2faabbcb914132cd2880b8e7bacf33e/lib/lita/handlers/time_card.rb\\\">time-card</a> handler for the <a href=\\\"https://www.lita.io/\\\">lita</a> bot, soon to be available for use in a chat room near you!</p>\\n\\n<p>Finally, we shipped a new merge-bot: <a href=\\\"https://github.com/bundlerbot\\\">@bundlerbot</a>. We’ve been using the <a href=\\\"http://homu.io\\\">homu.io</a> service for over a year, but a long-standing bug prevented us from managing team member permissions.

We need more companies to join as members for Ruby Together to be sustainable in the long run, so it’s exciting to have expert help. We’ll be working with Computer Modern in the coming weeks and months to create resources for Ruby developers and Ruby Together members.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"bundler-news\\\">bundler news</h2>\\n\\n<p>This month bundler and <a href=\\\"https://bundler.io\\\">bundler.io</a> got an array of documentation fixes / updates, due in large part to our new contributor <a href=\\\"https://github.com/colby-swandale\\\">@colby-swandale</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>Bundler got a <a href=\\\"https://github.com/bundler/rfcs\\\">Request For Comments</a> repo, inspired by the one utilized by <a href=\\\"https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/\\\">Rust</a>. We fixed <a href=\\\"https://github.com/bundler/bundler/pull/5176\\\">outdated not listing all outdated gems</a>. And we also <a href=\\\"https://github.com/bundler/bundler/pull/5213\\\">fixed an <code>ObjectBoundsExceededError</code></a> on <a href=\\\"https://rubinius.com/\\\">Rubinius</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>As mentioned last month, Bundler 1.13 shipped with <a href=\\\"http://bundler.io/blog/2016/09/08/bundler-1-13.html\\\"><code>required_ruby_version</code> support</a> for Gemfiles containing a <code>ruby</code> declaration. Building on that, we hoped to release 1.14 with automatic support for the currently running Ruby version.</p>\\n\\n<p>Over the last two months or so, the Bundler team has been discussing and experimenting with different ways to handle Gemfiles without an explicit <code>ruby</code>. The heroic @segiddins <a href=\\\"https://github.com/bundler/bundler/pull/5013\\\">attempted to implement</a> our rough consensus for the feature, but we ran into a plethora of edge cases and problems with backwards compatibility. In the end, we went back to the drawing board and designed a new way to handle it that should be much better.</p>\\n\\n<p>Downside: this work delayed Bundler 1.14, and now we’re going to ship 1.14 without automatic Ruby locking. Upside: it will be a much better feature when it’s done. Hooray.</p>\\n\\n<p>In total, 11 authors pushed 59 commits to Bundler last month. 61 files changed and there were 1,990 additions and 1,629 deletions.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"rubygemsorg-news\\\">rubygems.org news</h2>\\n\\n<p>This month in RubyGems.org, we <a href=\\\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/pull/1423\\\">improved</a> messaging for yanked and reserved namespace gems. <a href=\\\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/pull/1436\\\">Reduced</a> the database calls required for search requests.

It’s actually been about 18 months, but that didn’t sound as snappy. To celebrate, I’ve put together this summary of our history: why and how we exist, what we’ve done, and what the future holds.</p>\\n\\n<p>So, what even <em>is</em> Ruby Together? Ruby Together is a non-profit that pays developers to work on RubyGems, Bundler, and more, using funds from members. Members can be any person or company who uses Ruby, and the work we pay for is free for anyone to use.</p>\\n\\n<p>But what, exactly, does that mean? And why do we need a non-profit to do this in the first place? The explanation lies the current state of the Ruby community.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"there-are-some-problems\\\">there are some problems</h2>\\n<p>Put simply, the problem is that Ruby has grown up. The Ruby community has become so large that our existing community infrastructure isn’t sustainable anymore.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"the-gems-theyre-multiplying\\\">the gems! they’re multiplying!</h3>\\n<p>As you’ve probably noticed, Bundler makes it easier to use gems and makes it easier to create gems. Over the 6 years that I’ve spent working on Bundler, the number of gems in existence has multiplied, and the number of gem downloads has multiplied. There are now over 100,000 gems, and those gems have over a million versions.</p>\\n\\n<p>With those million versions comes a completely unprecedented number of downloads. In the years from 2003 to the end of 2014, we tracked roughly 2 billion gem downloads. That’s 2 billion downloads over more than ten years. Then, in 2015 alone (just one year!) we served 4 billion gem downloads.</p>\\n\\n<p>That is an <em>extremely</em> steep increase. If we were a startup, we’d have great graphs to show VCs and convince them to give us money. But we’re not a startup. Before Ruby Together, all of RubyGems.org was maintained for free by volunteers. That’s a problem, because at the same time that usage has been increasing exponentially, volunteer help hasn’t been increasing.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"the-volunteer-crisis\\\">the volunteer crisis</h3>\\n<p>Most people don’t realize this, but the RubyGems.org team is incredibly small. It’s never had more than four people on it, and most often has only had two. The Bundler team is even smaller—it’s never had more than two people working on it consistently, and often only one.</p>\\n\\n<p>None of those team members were ever paid for their work. To pay their bills, every single one of them has to have a full-time job doing something else. A few volunteers giving up their nights and weekends to help the community used to be enough, but it’s not anymore.</p>\\n\\n<p>Using open source ethically means supporting the tools and infrastructure you use, with money or  time. Instead of supporting our community infrastructure, companies are taking community resources and then not giving back. These companies are making millions (and sometimes billions) of dollars. They could easily afford to support us, but choose not to. Let me give an example that really highlights this point.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"remember-when-rubygemsorg-got-hacked\\\">remember when rubygems.org got hacked?</h3>\\n<p>About 3 years ago, RubyGems.org went down completely, for over a week.  There was a security issue, and although the team knew about the security issue and planned to fix it, everyone on the team had a day job. The best we could do was plan to fix the problem that weekend. Unfortunately, a motivated hacker figured out how to break to during the week.</p>\\n\\n<p>We had to take the servers down and create completely new servers from scratch. We also had to download and verify every single one of the hundreds of thousands of .gem files, to make sure the hacker hadn’t replaced any of them while he had access.</p>\\n\\n<p>During this time, hundreds of Ruby developers volunteered to help. This isn’t super surprising, since almost every Ruby developer and company depends on RubyGems.org in order to be able to do their work. What is terrible is that none of those volunteers could do anything useful. None of them were already familiar with how the servers worked, and helping them get up to speed would have slowed down the recovery efforts.</p>\\n\\n<p>The worst part, though, is that once RubyGems.org was back up… all of those volunteers disappeared. None of them were wiling to get up to speed and help out when there wasn’t an emergency. Even though the RubyGems infrastructure is vitally important to all of these companies, they can’t or won’t allow their employees to help make sure it keeps working.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"the-non-solution-of-open-source-jobs\\\">the non-solution of open source jobs</h3>\\n<p>At this point, you might say “Aha! But companies sometimes hire Ruby developers specifically to work on open source. Let’s just keep doing that.” While that is a great thing, and I am very glad that companies sometimes choose to do that, it is not a solution to the crisis we are facing.</p>\\n\\n<p>Very few companies have ever hired Ruby developers to work on open source full time. Even including all of the last 10 years, I can only think of Engine Yard, Sun, AT&amp;T, RedHat, Heroku, Shopify, GitHub. I’m sure there are others, but there can’t be that many.</p>\\n\\n<p>Even if there were more companies doing this, though, it would still be a problem. Engine Yard is the perfect example of a very helpful company turning out to be extremely disruptive to the community. At one point in time, Engine Yard (by itself!) employed not just the Rubinius and JRuby teams, but also everyone working full-time on Rails.</p>\\n\\n<p>Eventually, though, they decided to stop. After Engine Yard wound down their open source positions, the JRuby team had moved to another company, but the Rubinius team and Rails team no longer had any full-time developers. If a single executive at SalesForce changes their mind, most of the full-time developers on Ruby core will be out of a job. We can do better than a community dependent on one or two companies.</p>\\n\\n<p>Ruby Together spreads the costs across many companies and people. Everyone shares the costs of paying developers, and everyone shares the benefits. Even better, that sharing means we’re not dependent on any single company to be able to do our work. A single company changing their mind or cutting costs is no longer enough to disrupt the community.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"how-it-came-about\\\">how it came about</h2>\\n<p>Working on Bundler and RubyGems over the last six years had made these problems clear to me, but most of the people I talked to didn’t think they were important problems. Bundler and RubyGems had always gotten along with work from volunteers! Companies were able to build huge and wildly profitable companies on top of Ruby open source, so everything seemed fine.</p>\\n\\n<p>I spent years experimenting with different ideas for how Bundler and RubyGems could make enough money to support paying developers. I tested out support contracts, feature bounties, enterprise-only features, and more. None of them were enough of an improvement for companies to want to pay for them. Even worse, every option was a huge time-sink away from the actual goal of working on the open source projects.</p>\\n\\n<p>One company was willing to support Bundler directly, without any conditions or requirements: <a href=\\\"https://stripe.com\\\">Stripe</a>. Using funds from Stripe, I was able to do research, hire a lawyer, and found Ruby Together.</p>\\n\\n<p>Ruby Together incorporated as a particular kind of non-profit company—what the U.S. government calls a “trade association”. Other trade associations you may have heard of include the Linux Foundation, the Jquery Foundation, and the Sqlite Foundation, but the best-known example is the American Dairy Farmers’ Association.</p>\\n\\n<p>The American Dairy Farmers’ Association pays for the “Got Milk?” ad campaigns. Those ad campaigns cost more than a single dairy farmer could afford, but they benefit all dairy farmers by promoting milk. Each trade association uses membership dues to fund community projects that benefit all members of that trade, whether they belong to the association or not.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"what-weve-done\\\">what we’ve done</h2>\\n<p>Speaking of benefiting everyone, let’s talk about some of the things that Ruby Together has done in it’s first year and a half. The big, underlying thing that we did is pay for 1,100 hours of developer time. Using that developer time, we’ve gotten a lot of stuff done. I can’t possibly cover everything in detail, but even an overview will give you a taste of what goes into keeping <code>bundle install</code> working month after month, and year after year.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"bundler-accomplishments\\\">bundler accomplishments</h3>\\n<p>Working on Bundler, have completed and 5 feature releases. In <a href=\\\"http://bundler.io/blog/2015/03/21/hello-bundler-19.html\\\">Bundler 1.9</a>, we started using Molinillo, a new dependency manager. It was funded by a Stripe grant and shared between Bundler, RubyGems, and CocoaPods. In <a href=\\\"http://bundler.io/blog/2015/06/24/version-1-10-released.html\\\">Bundler 1.10</a>, we added the <code>lock</code> command, optional groups, conditional groups, and the ability to mute post-install messages per gem. (Finally, it’s possible to never be told “You must HTTParty hard” again!) In <a href=\\\"http://bundler.io/blog/2015/12/12/version-1-11-released.html\\\">Bundler 1.11</a>, we dramatically improved error messages both in general and when the Gemfile cannot be resolved. In <a href=\\\"http://bundler.io/blog/2016/04/28/the-new-index-format-fastly-and-bundler-1-12.html\\\">Bundler 1.12</a>, we finished a 3-year-long project and started using a new gem metadata file format that allows us to finally stop sending every user information about every gem every time they install. We also increased the speed of <code>bundle exec</code> and added support for locking and updating the Ruby version. In <a href=\\\"http://bundler.io/blog/2016/09/08/bundler-1-13.html\\\">Bundler 1.13</a>, we added support for gems with <code>required_ruby_version</code> for Gemfiles that declare their <code>ruby</code> version, added the <code>doctor</code> command to fix broken compiled gems, and added the ability to add and remove platforms you want Bundler to resolve for. And that was just a summary of the big features!</p>\\n\\n<p>We also released <a href=\\\"https://rubygems.org/gems/bundler/versions\\\">38 bugfix releases</a>, completely <a href=\\\"http://bundler.io/blog/2016/07/10/bundler-1-13-and-redesigned-bundler-io.html\\\">redesigned the Bundler website</a>, and mentored nine <a href=\\\"http://summerofcode.withgoogle.com\\\">Google Summer of Code</a> students and four <a href=\\\"http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org\\\">RailsGirls Summer of Code</a> students across two summers.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"now-rubygems-too\\\">now rubygems, too</h3>\\n<p>As part of keeping Bundler working, Ruby Together has taken over maintenance of the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems\\\">RubyGems project</a> as of 2016. Bundler already uses parts of RubyGems to install gems, and so it was a good fit. Even worse, ever since AT&amp;T Interactive shut down their Ruby open source department, RubyGems hasn’t had any dedicated development. For almost two years, the only significant change to RubyGems was a critical security fix.</p>\\n\\n<p>It was an awful situation. For that entire two years, installing compiled gems was broken on Windows for any Ruby version older than the latest. I’m very pleased to reveal that since the start of this year, we have fixed many bugs, including that one. Developers on Windows can install gems again. In total, we’ve released one minor and eight bugfix versions of RubyGems so far. We also have some great plans for RubyGems that I’ll cover in the section about the future, so keep reading!</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"oh-and-the-servers\\\">oh and the servers</h3>\\n<p>On the server side, we’ve done a huge amount of work on RubyGems.org and on the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/bundler/bundler-api\\\">Bundler dependency API</a>. I’ve previously given <a href=\\\"http://andre.arko.net/2013/12/09/extreme-makeover-rubygems-edition/\\\">a talk about setting up the Bundler API </a> as a separate thing from RubyGems.org. It’s not in my talk, but the biggest reason we had to do that was that at that time RubyGems.org didn’t have enough volunteers to stay functional if it ran the Bundler API as well.</p>\\n\\n<p>Because of that shortage, the Bundler dependency API is a completely separate application from RubyGems.org. Even though we now have one team cooperating to run everything, we have had to keep paying the cost of two separate systems: one for the gem metadata, and one for the gems themselves.</p>\\n\\n<p>For the last year and a half, we’ve applied countless security patches and  implemented the server-side part of the <a href=\\\"http://andre.arko.net/2014/03/28/the-new-rubygems-index-format/\\\">new index format</a> used by Bundler 1.12. We’ve even ported the entire Bundler API Sinatra app into the RubyGems.org Rails app. Someday very soon, we’ll only have one platform to keep operational. That’s a big win, giving us more reliability while requiring us to do less work. We also switched to using the <a href=\\\"http://fastly.com\\\">Fastly CDN</a> for gem downloads, and we have ever so slowly reworked the entire architecture of RubyGems.org so that every page can be served from Fastly’s closest data center instead of from Amazon’s US-West region.</p>\\n\\n<p>On top of all of that proactive maintenance, we have paid developers to take on incident response. It’s much easier to prioritize keeping all of these systems operational when it’s paid work. Our team has handled around a dozen outages over the last 18 months, and every one of them has been shorter than it would have been without Ruby Together.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"gemstash-also-pretty-neat\\\">gemstash, also pretty neat</h3>\\n<p>One more thing that we did: we built a new tool to help everyone manage the gems that they need. It’s called <a href=\\\"https://github.com/bundler/gemstash\\\">Gemstash</a>, and it’s a server you can run that will cache every gem you download from RubyGems.org. You can run one on your local laptop to avoid downloading gems multiple times. You can run one in your office to speed up installing the gems your application needs. Or you can run one in your datacenter, and install gems across all your server from a local source. It can even act as a server for private gems, so you can keep your company’s internal gems on it, too.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"bundler-20-is-coming\\\">bundler 2.0 is coming</h3>\\n<p>Later this fall, we’re going to release <a href=\\\"https://github.com/bundler/bundler/issues/4853\\\">Bundler 1.14</a>, and then <a href=\\\"https://github.com/bundler/bundler/issues/4856\\\">Bundler 2.0</a> after that. When we were designing Bundler 1.0, we made tradeoffs based on a world that didn’t use Bundler. Today, not only Ruby developers but developers in most languages have a dependency manager—the old tradeoffs are a problem now, instead of a benefit.</p>\\n\\n<p>Plus, it’s a huge drain on our time to keep supporting Ruby 1.8.7 and all the other ancient versions of Ruby and RubyGems that were new at the time Bundler was originally released. The functionality provided by Bundler won’t change, and everyone will be able to use Bundler 1 in some projects and Bundler 2 in others on the same machine. I’m really excited about the improvements that are possible with backwards-breaking changes, and I’m looking forward to sharing those with you later this year or early next year.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"plus-were-going-to-merge-bundler-and-rubygems\\\">plus we’re going to merge bundler and rubygems</h3>\\n<p>Oh, and one more thing. For the last six years of working on Bundler, one of the most frustrating things about working on it has been the separation between Bundler and RubyGems. Sometimes making a change in one would break something in the other. The rest of the time it has just been a huge pain to make sure that they work to install gems the same way even when they aren’t working together.</p>\\n\\n<p>By talking to developers, companies, and the teams working on Bundler, RubyGems, and RubyGems.org, we’ve come up with a plan to combine the Bundler and RubyGems projects. They’ll still have separate commands, <code>gem</code> and <code>bundle</code>, but they’ll have a single codebase behind them. This summer, we mapped out everything that needed to be done for that merger, and started working on it.</p>\\n\\n<p>After Bundler 2 is released, the main focus of the Bundler and RubyGems teams will be merging the codebases together into <a href=\\\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/issues/1681\\\">RubyGems+Bundler 3.0</a>.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"somehow-its-working\\\">somehow, it’s working!</h2>\\n<p>In many ways, the last year and a half has been more successful than I could have dreamed. Ruby Together is paying developers for work every week. We’ve fixed more bugs and made more progress on Bundler and RubyGems in the last year than we managed in the three years before that. We started out especially strong, and we saw new companies and developers signing up every single month for an entire year.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"but-its-not-all-good\\\">but it’s not all good</h3>\\n<p>But for the last six months, even as we’ve set new records for paid hours, while we managed the <a href=\\\"https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com\\\">Google Summer of Code</a> project for all of Ruby, and while we made these exciting plans to finally bring RubyGems and Bundler together… membership has been flat. We’ve seen a few new members, but a few members have left. Overall, we’re in the same place after 18 months as we were after 12 months: able to pay consistently for several hours a week, but not yet able to pay even two people part-time.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"companies-are-short-sighted\\\">companies are short-sighted</h3>\\n<p>Businesses are ultimately answerable to shareholders who want profit, and right now businesses think that they can get the benefits of Ruby community infrastructure and tools without needing to contribute back themselves. It’s always worked before, right?</p>\\n\\n<p>Just because it’s worked in the past doesn’t mean it will keep working in the future. As I showed earlier, the demands of the community keep growing. The situation we have now is unsustainable. RubyGems was broken on Windows for two years! Everyone in the Ruby community needs to know about the crisis that we’re heading towards. Every company in the community needs to understand that we can’t keep giving them a free ride even if we wanted to.</p>\\n\\n<p>Some companies (like <a href=\\\"https://stripe.com\\\">Stripe</a>, <a href=\\\"http://codeminer42.com\\\">CodeMiner42</a>, <a href=\\\"http://basecamp.com\\\">Basecamp</a>, <a href=\\\"http://travis-ci.com\\\">Travis</a>, and others) have stepped up to support us with actual money. Other companies tell us it’s a great initiative, and they’re really glad we exist, but they’re not willing to pitch in. We haven’t seen any new companies join for almost six months. If that keeps up, we won’t even be able to keep up paying for a few hours of work per week. If companies keep taking community benefits without giving back, it takes us straight back to unsustainable volunteers burning themselves out.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"cooperating-is-good-for-everyone\\\">cooperating is good for everyone</h3>\\n<p>We don’t want that! There’s a better way. It’s not even hard, or expensive. At Ruby Together, we’re already prepared to keep everything working—we just need support from Ruby developers and companies to make that possible.</p>\\n\\n<p>We offer the entire community a great deal: free tools and free hosting for Ruby code they want to share with the world. We offer a fantastic deal for companies, too: the benefits of full-time infrastructure developers at a tiny fraction of the cost.</p>\\n\\n<p>So for now, we’re asking: help us work on <a href=\\\"https://bundler.io\\\">Bundler</a>, <a href=\\\"https://rubygems.org\\\">RubyGems</a>, and everything else by <a href=\\\"https://rubytogether.org/join\\\">signing up</a>. Everything we build with money from the community is shared back to the community, and that’s what Ruby Together is all about.</p>\\n\\n\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}"},{"title":"August 2016 Monthly Update","status":"published","published_at":1472515200,"mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"html\",{\"cardName\":\"html\",\"html\":\"\\n\\n<p>Welcome to the Ruby Together update for August 2016.

Finally, we received nomination(s) for board members this month and will be holding an election to decide the state of the new Ruby Together board.</p>\\n\\n<p>We had three new developers join as members: James Wen, Adam Becker, and Asad Akbar. Three companies joined: <a href=\\\"https://thoughtbot.com/\\\">Thoughtbot</a>, <a href=\\\"https://www.geckoboard.com/\\\">Geckoboard</a>, and <a href=\\\"https://www.sabre.com/\\\">Sabre Corp</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://thoughtbot.com/\\\">Thoughtbot</a> is a consulting company with small teams of designers and developers in 10 cities around the world, making software for clients, and contributing to open source software.</p>\\n\\n<p>Although <a href=\\\"http://icelab.com.au/\\\">Icelab</a> joined us last month, we forgot to mention them in last month’s newsletter, so here they are: <a href=\\\"http://icelab.com.au/\\\">Icelab</a> is a studio in Australia with a team of problem solvers who want to work with you to build a better world.

These changes were mainly bug fixes for the new index format, but we also fixed several issues running Bundler on continuous integration servers. We also worked on upcoming releases this month, specifically breaking changes for Bundler 2.0 and the plugin system that’s been in progress for some time now. On the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/bundler/bundler-api\\\">Bundler-api</a> side, we set up a new follower database and then promoted it to primary status. The new primary database means we’ll be able to avoid downtime when AWS services the old primary database later this month.</p>\\n\\n<p>In total, <a href=\\\"https://github.com/bundler/bundler\\\">Bundler</a> and <a href=\\\"https://github.com/bundler/bundler-api\\\">Bundler-api</a> had 25 merged pull requests and 119 commits from 10 authors, and we closed 53 closed issues.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"rubygemsorg-news\\\">rubygems.org news</h2>\\n\\n<p>RubyGems.org had 24 merged pull requests and 59 commits from 13 authors.

Next up is porting the Bundler API’s new index format, working towards our goal of a single unified application to serve the entire site.</p>\\n\\n<p>This month the team also <a href=\\\"http://blog.rubygems.org/2016/05/20/rubygems-org-2016-push.html\\\">blogged about ways to improve RubyGems.org for 2016</a> by increasing contributors, updating policies, and decreasing response times on support issues. Many of the issues described there are due to RubyGems support having been run by volunteers, which Ruby Together is working on addressing! The financial support of Ruby community members like you is making all of this possible. &lt;3</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"rubygems-news\\\">rubygems news</h2>\\n\\n<p>In the last month, RubyGems merged 13 pull requests, containing 15 commits by 8 authors.

Ruby Together has been around for an entire year. It’s been a really busy year, but we’ve gotten a lot of great stuff done. In our first year, we’ve handled security issues and outages on RubyGems.org and released new versions of Bundler and RubyGems as well as implementing the new index format. We also created and released <a href=\\\"https://github.com/bundler/gemstash\\\">Gemstash</a>, a server anyone can run to host private gem, or caching public ones. We’re extremely proud of what we’ve managed to accomplish in our first year, and we’re planning to get even more done in year two!</p>\\n\\n<p>As part of being one year old, it’s time for the yearly board elections. The first step in those elections is nominations. If you’re a member and you want to nominate someone for election to the Ruby Together board, you can!

Excitingly, this is the first release to use the <a href=\\\"http://andre.arko.net/2014/03/28/the-new-rubygems-index-format/\\\">new index format</a>. Designing the new index, implementing a server and a client, and rolling it out has taken over two years, but it’s finally done. The new index format means that <code>bundle install</code> will be noticeably faster (especially when no new gems versions have been released since the last time you installed). The server-side is also hugely improved, since all the gem data is served by the Fastly CDN from a data center near you, all around the world.</p>\\n\\n<p>We also saw 29 merged pull requests and 67 commits from 8 authors for the Bundler client and server. Finally, we created a set of <a href=\\\"https://github.com/bundler/bundler/milestones\\\">milestones</a> for how Bundler will progress for 1.13, 1.14, and on to 3.0.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"rubygemsorg-news\\\">rubygems.org news</h2>\\n\\n<p>RubyGems.org got 13 merge requests and 85 commits from 8 authors.

We spent that time on Bundler, RubyGems, RubyGems.org, and Google Summer of Code for Ruby. We had six new members join: Tom Johnson, Francis Luong (Franco), Patrick McSweeny, Dan Sherson, Andrew Nesbitt, and Jeffrey Baird.</p>\\n\\n<p>The bad news is that no new companies joined last month, for the first time since Ruby Together was started. If your company hasn’t joined yet, this would be a good time to encourage them! On the other hand, the good news is that even with no new corporate members, we can afford to pay for 25 hours of development work every week. That’s 100 hours of maintenance and improvements every month on Ruby community infrastructure that was previously being done without compensation, or more likely not being done at all.</p>\\n\\n<p>In other news, the GSoC student application deadline was this Friday, and we’ve spent much of the month communicating with students about potential projects and their proposals. In all, we received 41 applications, including projects in Bundler, RubyGems.org, Rails, JRuby, and MRI itself.</p>\\n\\n<p>Over the next month, we’ll be reviewing proposals and requesting slots from Google for the students we want to accept. Last year, we were able to work with every student whose proposal we decided to accept. Hopefully we’ll be able to do that again this year, too.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"bundler-news\\\">Bundler News</h2>\\n\\n<p>Bundler got a fair amount of ongoing maintenance this month, with 45 new commits and 24 merged pull requests from 12 different authors. We also finished the prerelease cycle for Bundler 1.12, and pushed the release candidate to RubyGems.org. If we don’t find any bugs, it will be the final version! Give it a try by running <code>gem install bundler --pre</code> and [let us know] if you run into any problems.</p>\\n\\n<p>On the Bundler API side of things, we saw 24 new commits and 13 merged pull requests from 7 authors. When the API started [returning 503 responses last week], we were able to investigate, mitigate the issue by adding capacity, continue monitoring, and completely resolve the problem the next day. We also added a graph of API responses to [the RubyGems.org status page] so that future issues will be easier to see. Everything is back to working smoothly, and no one had to take unpaid time off of work to do it, thanks to your support for Ruby Together! Good work, everyone.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"rubygemsorg-news\\\">RubyGems.org News</h2>\\n\\n<p>The RubyGems.org repo saw 15 pull requests merged, including 99 commits from 10 authors. We added a new application server, fixed a bevy of small issues, and shipped the new download counting setup that works with Fastly from staging to production! If everything goes according to plan, all of RubyGems.org will be served directly from Fastly within the next month.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"rubygems-news\\\">RubyGems News</h2>\\n\\n<p>RubyGems saw some nice progress as well, with 20 pull requests merged, containing 33 commits from 9 authors. Fixes included finding the right gem on different platforms, finding the right gem executable stub, and always running the newest installed version of a gem. We released RubyGems version 2.6.2 with some of those fixes, and we’ll be releasing 2.6.3 shortly with the rest of them.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"budget--expenses\\\">Budget &amp; Expenses</h2>\\n\\n<p>From Feburary 20 to March 19, Ruby Together took in $18,140.

Just in time to wrap up 2015, this is the monthly update for December 2015. In the last month, we paid for 40 hours of work on Bundler and RubyGems.org, 2 developers joined, and 4 companies joined. The end of the year is always a quiet time, but we were still able to make some great progress.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"ruby-together-news\\\">Ruby Together news</h2>\\n\\n<p>The biggest news is that we’ve started to pay for work on <a href=\\\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems\\\">RubyGems</a>! The <code>gem</code> command and associated libraries, which ship as part of Ruby itself, will get some love from <a href=\\\"https://github.com/copiousfreetime/\\\">Jeremy Hinegardner</a> and <a href=\\\"https://github.com/krainboltgreene\\\">Kurtis Rainbolt-Greene</a>. Hooray! 🎉</p>\\n\\n<p>We were also joined by two new developer members, including Brian Buchalter, and 4 new companies, including <a href=\\\"https://appcanary.com\\\">Appcanary</a> and <a href=\\\"http://bitcrowd.net\\\">bitcrowd</a>. With these new members, our total monthly income is now projected to be $16,620 per month. As this amount increases, we plan to increase developer hours spent on Bundler, RubyGems and RubyGems.org, moving from 15 hours per week towards full-time work on Ruby infrastructure. If you’re not a member yet, help us reach that goal by <a href=\\\"https://rubytogether.org/join\\\">joining today</a>.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"bundler-news\\\">Bundler news</h2>\\n\\n<p>The last month was very productive for Bundler. We released <a href=\\\"http://bundler.io/blog/2015/12/12/version-1-11-released.html\\\">Bundler 1.11</a>. The biggest new features are the error messages: our goal is to never show an exception and backtrace while running the <code>bundle</code> command, and instead print a message that explains what the problem is and suggests solutions if any are available. This release was a huge step in that direction. We now catch many, many errors that were previously uncaught, especially ones around filesystem permissions and access problems.</p>\\n\\n<p>The other big error message improvement was in the resolver. When your Gemfile contains gems that can’t all be installed together, the error message will now show every gem’s current version, the version you asked for, and the versions that ultimately conflicted. It doesn’t happen a lot, but when it does, the new messages make it much, much easier to resolve the problem.</p>\\n\\n<p>The third big feature of 1.11 wasn’t actually a feature: we fixed bugs. Lots of bugs. We fixed over 50 bugs, making this version of Bundler the most stable one we have ever released. To start using Bundler 1.11 today, just run <code>gem install bundler</code>, and you’re good to go! All told, in the last months 9 different authors pushed 199 new commits, working on Bundler version 1.11 and upcoming versions 1.12 and 2.0.</p>\\n\\n<p>Next month, we’ll be working hard on Bundler 1.12, with support for <a href=\\\"http://andre.arko.net/2014/03/28/the-new-rubygems-index-format/\\\">new RubyGems index format</a>! It’s really exciting to see more than two years of work finally paying off with increased speed and reliability.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"rubygemsorg-news\\\">RubyGems.org news</h2>\\n\\n<p>In the last month, 10 authors pushed 54 commits to the RubyGems.org and RubyGems infrastructure repositories. We improved search, added a new API endpoint with information about single versions of gems, improved the copywriting on the site itself, and dramatically improved the Spanish translation.</p>\\n\\n<p>We also settled on the final plan for processing download counts with Fastly, and started working on the implementation. Once that stats system is set up, we’ll be ready to switch the entire RubyGems.org site over to be served by Fastly.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"budget--expenses\\\">Budget &amp; Expenses</h2>\\n\\n<p>From November 19 to December 18, including Airbnb paying up front for an entire year, Ruby Together took in $28,775. In total, we spent $12,366.34. Here’s a breakdown of where the money went:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n  <li>$3,000 for 20 hours of developer time on Bundler at $150/hour</li>\\n  <li>$3,000 for 20 hours of developer time on RubyGems.org at $150/hour</li>\\n  <li>$71.34 on dedicated servers for RubyBench.org</li>\\n  <li>$506.90 on payment processing fees</li>\\n  <li>$1,399.68 on company overhead like hosting, services, software, hardware, taxes, etc.</li>\\n  <li>$1,077.50 on accounting, copywriting, design, and other professional services</li>\\n  <li>$3,310.92 on community outreach including stickers, conferences, etc.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>We made great progress on Bundler and RubyGems.org this month.

André also spoke at RubyConf, and occasionally manned the table as well. At our RubyConf table, we distributed shirts, stickers, and information to anyone who was interested.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Ruby Together shirts were extremely popular, with all 250 gone in less than an hour! They were so popular, in fact, that we’re going to be launching a new site where everyone can get their hands on one in a design and size that makes them happy.</p>\\n\\n<p>There were eight new developers who joined us since last update, including Leo Liang, Abdullah Esmail, and Kazuho Yamaguchi, Ryan Bigg, Ravil Bayramgalin, Teng Siong Ong, Jason Charnes, and Nikki Murray.</p>\\n\\n<p>Nine new companies signed up, including <a href=\\\"http://www.codeminer42.com/\\\">CodeMiner 42</a>, <a href=\\\"https://about.gitlab.com/\\\">GitLab</a>, <a href=\\\"http://www.appfolioinc.com/\\\">AppFolio</a>, <a href=\\\"https://www.kindlyops.com/\\\">Kindly Ops</a>, <a href=\\\"http://binarynoggin.com/\\\">Binary Noggin</a>, and <a href=\\\"https://appcanary.com/\\\">Appcanary</a>. CodeMiner 42 deserves a special shout-out for being the second company ever at the Sapphire level, along with Stripe.</p>\\n\\n<p>Thank you to everyone who signed up! With the new memberships, our projected monthly income has now reached $16,550 per month.</p>\\n\\n<div class=\\\"clear\\\"><img alt=\\\"$16,550 per month means 2-3 devs at 5 hours per week\\\" src=\\\"https://rubytogether.org/email/2015-11-30-november-2015-monthly-update/roadmap-status.png\\\" width=\\\"520\\\" /></div>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"bundler-news\\\">Bundler news</h3>\\n\\n<p>This was a great month for Bundler, as well. A prerelease of version 1.11 has been pushed to RubyGems.org, and anyone can use it with <code>gem install bundler --pre</code>. In a week or so, once we’ve seen it working in the wild, we’ll update the website at <a href=\\\"http://bundler.io\\\">bundler.io</a> and announce the changes with a full blog post there. In the meantime, here’s a brief summary of what’s new:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n  <li>Dramatically improved messages on permission errors</li>\\n  <li>Resolver conflict messages now show the conflicting version numbers</li>\\n  <li>Git repos using HTTP can have credentials set via <code>bundle config</code></li>\\n  <li>Update gems without installing them using <code>bundle lock --update</code></li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>This release also lays the groundwork for version 1.12, which will include the (nearly complete!) new index changes, and is on its way to you as fast as is humanly possible.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Bundler team also released <a href=\\\"https://github.com/bundler/gemstash\\\">Gemstash</a> a completely new project that’s been in the works for a while. Gemstash is mainly the work of <a href=\\\"https://github.com/smellsblue\\\">@smellsblue</a>, <a href=\\\"https://github.com/pcarranza\\\">@pcarranza</a>, and <a href=\\\"https://github.com/indirect\\\">@indirect</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>Gemstash can act as a gem caching server, storing copies of the gems you need from RubyGems.org. This can be particularly useful if you have an office full of pairing machines, a data center full of app servers, or any other time when you need to install the same gems onto many machines. By running Gemstash locally, you can download that gem from far-off RubyGems.org just once, and then install it from Gemstash after that. Much faster.</p>\\n\\n<p>The other big thing Gemstash offers is private gem hosting. If your company has been using private git repos in order to avoid an internal gem server, or if you have an internal gem server that never seems to work correctly, start using Gemstash! Git gems require copying the entire history of every gem, which includes a lot of data that is never used, so releasing private gems can speed things up.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"rubygems-news\\\">RubyGems news</h3>\\n\\n<p>The Bundler news was really long, so I’ll try to keep the RubyGems.org news brief: we applied security updates, merged pull requests, upgraded gems, migrated to a new version of Chef, worked on the Fastly migration, handled an (accidental-looking) DoS attack, and generally kept everything running smoothly. If progress with the Fastly transition continues at this rate, we should be completely moved over within the next two or three months.</p>\\n\\n<p>Eagle eyes may have noticed that this section used to be called “RubyGems.org news”, but is now called “RubyGems news”. That’s because Ruby Together is also going to be able fund work on the <code>gem</code> command and the RubyGems client! Exactly as we’ve hoped since the beginning, more members means we have the budget for more developer time. The RubyGems library ships inside Ruby itself, and is used extensively by Bundler, and could really use some maintenance. Check back here next month for an update on our progress finding someone to tackle RubyGems.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"budget--expenses\\\">Budget &amp; Expenses</h2>\\n\\n<p>From September 19 to October 18, Ruby Together took in $16,315. In total, we spent $15,830. Here’s a breakdown of where that money went:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n  <li>$3,000 for 20 hours of developer time on Bundler at $150/hour</li>\\n  <li>$3,000 for 20 hours of developer time on RubyGems.org at $150/hour</li>\\n  <li>$73.56 in dedicated servers for RubyBench.org</li>\\n  <li>$499.09 on payment processing fees</li>\\n  <li>$877.69 on company overhead like hosting, services, software, hardware, taxes, etc.</li>\\n  <li>$400 on accounting, copywriting, design, and other professional services</li>\\n  <li>$4,735.43 on community outreach including stickers, conferences, etc.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>As you may have noticed, we’ve started spending a bit more on community outreach. It seems to be working! The Ruby community has been very encouraging and enthusiastic, and so we’re going to keep doing everything we can to let everyone know that we exist.</p>\\n\\n<p>In the upcoming month, both André and Carina will be working on outreach and evangelism projects. If we can find the right developers, we’ll also start paying for work on the RubyGems client library and gem command, following our roadmap.</p>\\n\\n<p>Thanks for the support, everyone!<br />\\nWe couldn’t do it without you. &lt;3</p>\\n\\n<p>Until next time,<br />\\nAndré and the Ruby Together team</p>\\n\\n\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}"},{"title":"October 2015 Monthly Update","status":"published","published_at":1446163200,"mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"html\",{\"cardName\":\"html\",\"html\":\"\\n\\n<p>Just in time for Halloween, it’s the Ruby Together monthly update for October 2015!

André also attended EuRuKo, the European Ruby Conference, and gave a lightning talk about Ruby Together.</p>\\n\\n<p>Attendees at both conferences were very positive and excited about the idea of Ruby Together, but most of them were hearing about Ruby Together for the first time. Since it seems like most Ruby developers and companies haven’t heard about Ruby Together yet, we’re going to work on doing more conferences and outreach in the coming months.</p>\\n\\n<p>Since the last update, we’ve had three new companies join: <a href=\\\"http://contribsys.com\\\">Contributed Systems</a> (makers of the popular <a href=\\\"http://sidekiq.org\\\">Sidekiq</a> gem), <a href=\\\"http://estately.com\\\">Estately</a>, and <a href=\\\"http://devmynd.com\\\">DevMynd</a>.

Thanks for your support, everyone!</p>\\n\\n<p>With those new members, our projected monthly income is now $13,100 per month. With that income, we’ll be able to not only pay for maintenance work on Bundler and RubyGems.org, but also pay for outreach and evangelism work to let more companies know about what we’re doing. With more companies, we’ll be able to support more Ruby open source projects and get things done even faster. Hooray!</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"bundler-news\\\">Bundler news</h2>\\n\\n<p>Excluding merge commits, this month the Bundler repository saw 136 commits by 17 authors. 28 pull requests were merged, and a good amount of progress was made on bug fixes, new features, and future plans.</p>\\n\\n<p>The most significant progress was on the new <a href=\\\"https://github.com/bundler/gemstash\\\">gemstash</a> project, an open source server for hosting gems. Gemstash is able to act as a caching proxy for RubyGems.org, providing local copies of gems for a data center or office. It is also able to host private or internal gems, and offers an easy way for teams to migrate away from using gems directly out of git repositories. We’re not quite at 1.0, but everything is already working! We’ll have a release candidate out shortly once we’ve polished up the documentation and done a bit more QA testing.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"rubygemsorg-news\\\">RubyGems.org news</h2>\\n\\n<p>On RubyGems.org and associated repositories, 23 pull requests were merged, and in total 20 authors pushed 114 commits.</p>\\n\\n<p>The SSL certificate for status.rubygems.org was renewed and updated, and the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/rubygems/adoption-center\\\">gem adoption center project</a> continues to make progress after the end of the RailsGirls Summer of Code.</p>\\n\\n<p>We also applied many security updates, continued work on the integration with Fastly, and shipped a beta version of the completely rewritten new-and-improved search.

Last month, about 45% of our total data transfer was served by Fastly while this month it should be closer to 90%. The RubyGems.org servers were upgraded to use Ruby 2.2.2, for the latest performance and security improvements.</p>\\n\\n<p>We also added publicly accessible backups of our Redis server, hardened the site against failing services, applied security patches, upgraded gems, updated packages, reviewed pull requests, and answered support tickets. It was a busy month!</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"budget--expenses\\\">Budget &amp; Expenses</h2>\\n\\n<p>Thanks to one company pre-paying for over 9 months, Ruby Together took in $19,239.00 over the last month.</p>\\n\\n<p>Thanks to that extra money, we were able to repay a loan that covered our initial startup costs. We also bought some software and hardware that will help us do our jobs more easily.</p>\\n\\n<p>In total, we spent $16,033.77. Here’s a breakdown of our spending by category:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n  <li>$3,000 for 20 hours of developer time on Bundler at $150/hour</li>\\n  <li>$3,000 for 20 hours of developer time on RubyGems.org at $150/hour</li>\\n  <li>$74.63 in dedicated servers for RubyBench.org</li>\\n  <li>$611.98 in payment processing fees</li>\\n  <li>$4,438.16 on company overhead like hosting, services, software, hardware, taxes, etc.</li>\\n  <li>$2,185 on accounting, copywriting, design, and other professional services</li>\\n  <li>$2,205 to finish repaying company-founding expenses, including legal counsel and government fees</li>\\n  <li>$549 on community outreach including stickers, conferences, etc.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>As predicted, our spending on professional services has gone down now that we’re a bit more established as a company. In the coming months, we expect to start spending more on community outreach and conferences.</p>\\n\\n<p>Right now, the most common response when we approach developers and companies is simply “what’s Ruby Together?

The <a href=\\\"https://rubytogether.org/roadmap\\\">Ruby Together roadmap</a> showcases those plans, while the new <a href=\\\"https://rubytogether.org/companies#faq\\\">faq</a> answers your questions.</p>\\n\\n<p>Founding board member <a href=\\\"http://twitter.com/tenderlove\\\">Aaron Patterson</a> informed us that while he is still “on board” with Ruby Together, he needed to retire from our board of directors. Instead of leaving his seat empty, the board conducted a search, and we have appointed <a href=\\\"http://twitter.com/coralineada\\\">Coraline Ada Ehmke</a> as an interim board member. Best wishes to Aaron, who will now have more time to spend with his cats, and welcome to Coraline!</p>\\n\\n<p>Finally, as the culmination of weeks of planning, we were able to announce that Ruby Together will only fund development work on open source projects that adhere to a code of conduct for maintainers and contributors.

As a result, we spent dozens of hours talking with users, coming up with workarounds, and trying to help everyone upgrade to the newest version of Bundler as smoothly as possible. An overview of the problems and the results of that work are also discussed in the release announcement, so reading it is probably worth your time.</p>\\n\\n<p>Since the last update, <a href=\\\"https://www.google-melange.com\\\">Google Summer of Code</a> kicked off, bringing four student contributors to Bundler!

The logging system that’s been in progress got some attention, and we’ll be migrating to a new service in July that should need much less maintenance in the future. We switched to using a new chatbot, improved our Fastly config to reduce client errors and position us for the full Fastly migration, and started work on improved search. Finally, two new ops members joined the volunteer team, bringing the ops team up to 4 members.</p>\\n\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org\\\">RailsGirls Summer of Code</a> also started, with a team working on RubyGems.org.

Codes of conduct, which started primarily as a means of improving conferences and other events, have gained traction over the past year with open source projects as well. The <a href=\\\"http://contributor-covenant.org\\\">Contributor Covenant</a> is one of the most popular of these codes of conduct, and has been adopted by dozens of open source projects including Bundler, GitLab, AngularJS, rubygems.org, and RubyBench.</p>\\n\\n<p>Being overt in our openness is a first step toward making the Ruby community a better place. It is in this spirit that Ruby Together is announcing a new policy regarding open source Ruby projects that we will support: to be eligible, a project must have a clear and enforceable code of conduct that applies to all contributors and maintainers, and project owners must make a commitment to ensuring that the policies laid out by that code of conduct are enforced.</p>\\n\\n<p>We as a community have created something special, and it’s our responsibility to ensure that our core values are clearly communicated and shared by everyone.

This was our first month in operation, and we were able to make a huge amount of progress this month.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"new-hires\\\">New hires</h2>\\n\\n<p>This month, Ruby Together hired André Arko (that’s me!) to work on Bundler, which led to the release of several significant new features, detailed in the “New releases” section below.</p>\\n\\n<p>We also hired David Radcliffe, starting to pay him for his work on the RubyGems.org servers and infrastructure. David has worked tirelessly for years to ensure that RubyGems.org stays up to serve gems to the world. As a volunteer, David has spent countless nights and weekends donating his time and expertise to the Ruby community, and he richly deserves to be paid a fair rate for his work that benefits every person and company using Ruby.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"new-projects\\\">New projects</h2>\\n\\n<p>As planned, Ruby Together hired André Arko to continue ongoing maintenance and feature work on Bundler.</p>\\n\\n<p>Next, shortly after our public launch, we were able to form <a href=\\\"https://rubytogether.org/rubygems\\\">The RubyGems Partnership</a> together with <a href=\\\"http://rubycentral.org\\\">Ruby Central</a>. As part of that partnership, we have hired <a href=\\\"http://github.com/dwradcliffe\\\">David Radcliffe</a> to support his ongoing maintenance and development work on RubyGems.org.</p>\\n\\n<p>In addition to Bundler and RubyGems, we were able to start supporting the RubyBench.org project by funding the dedicated server that the benchmark suite runs on. Since RubyBench is a benchmarking project, it is vital that the test suite run on its own hardware, and that the hardware always be exactly the same. In the future, we plan to support active development of RubyBench as a valuable community resource.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"bundler-work-log\\\">Bundler work log</h2>\\n\\n<p>The last month included a record number of Bundler releases: we released versions 1.7.14, 1.8.6, 1.8.7, 1.9.0, 1.9.1, 1.9.2, 1.9.3, and 1.9.4.</p>\\n\\n<p>The 1.7.14 fix addressed a couple of small bugs and one regression, and we have since wound down ongoing support work for the 1.7.x release branch.</p>\\n\\n<p>The 1.8.6 and 1.8.7 releases fixed edge cases when installing multiple compiled gems in parallel, updating only the requested gem when multiple gems came from a specific gem server, and fixed a regression that could suppress errors that occurred while Bundler required a gem.</p>\\n\\n<p>The big news, though, was the 1.9 release! Bundler 1.9 is the first version to feature the shiny new dependency resolver Molinillo, written by CocoaPods team member Samuel Giddins. For three months, Ruby Together member Stripe sponsored Samuel to develop a dependency resolver from scratch in Ruby.</p>\\n\\n<p>That project was a rousing success, and the resulting resolver has now shipped in both CocoaPods and Bundler. It’s even been <a href=\\\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/1189\\\">submitted to RubyGems as a pull request</a>. As a result of this cooperation between all three Ruby projects that manage dependencies, any improvements or bugfixes to the dependency resolver in one of the projects can be shared among all of them. You can <a href=\\\"http://bundler.io/blog/2015/03/21/hello-bundler-19.html\\\">read more about the 1.9 release</a> on the Bundler blog.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"rubygemsorg-work-log\\\">RubyGems.org work log</h2>\\n\\n<p>RubyGems.org maintenance this month included several security upgrades, including an upgrade to Ruby version 2.1.6. We also started work on a centralized logging service for all the systems that keep RubyGems.org running, which will be a big help when work needs to be done in the future.</p>\\n\\n<p>Development work included several small fixes and upgrades, while the primary focus was on designing and implementing an upcoming policy change: soon, yanked gems will be deleted rather than simply removed from the main gem index. This change should significantly reduce the number of support tickets that the RubyGems.org team has to answer, and make the entire yanking process act the way that users expect it to.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"meet-the-team\\\">Meet the team!</h2>\\n\\n<p>This upcoming week, André, David, and several Ruby Together board members will all be attending RailsConf 2015 in Atlanta, GA. As well as attending, André will be giving a talk titled “How Does Bundler Work, Anyway?” on Tuesday, April 21 at 11am in room 204 CDE.</p>\\n\\n<p>If you’ll be at the conference, say hello to us—we’ll have Ruby Together stickers for you!</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"coming-up\\\">Coming up…</h2>\\n\\n<p>During May, the Bundler team will be working on finishing the 1.10 and 1.11 releases, which will include several useful new features and a major optimization to how long it takes to run <code>bundle install</code>. Keep an eye out for more about those changes in next month’s newsletter.</p>\\n\\n<p>The RubyGems.org team will be working to finish the consolidated logging changes that were started in April, and starting work on revamping the worldwide gem mirrors to use the same automation infrastructure that was just finished for the main site.

Even more mind-boggling: in the next few weeks we’ll be winding down a decade. This was a tough year. We want to commend and thank all of the developers who helped us maintain healthy projects and a kind community in a year where no connection or offer of support was taken for granted.</p>\\n\\n<p>It might be easy for any of us to list all the ways this year seemed to limit us. We’d love to offer you a moment to reflect with us on what we’re grateful for in the Ruby Together community.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>1. Five years of Ruby Together!</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>We can’t let the end of this year pass without acknowledging our five year anniversary! In 2015 Ruby Together incorporated as a solution to the dire need for\\nconsistent contributors to Ruby projects that provide infrastructure for the entire community; in particular Bundler, RubyGems and RubyGems.org. Five years and a \\npandemic later… and we’re still being supported by our community. We can’t thank you enough for demonstrating how valuable and worthwhile funding this work is to you.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>2. A Source of stability this year</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>We really want to brag about our uptime. Before Ruby Together, with Bundler and Ruby Gems run entirely by just a couple of extremely part-time volunteers, outages could last a day and even — on a few occasions — multiple days in a row. In fact, a week-long outage due to a security issue directly led to the founding of Ruby Together.</p>\\n\\n<p>All of Ruby Together’s work has been worth it: as of December 8, we have managed 99.997% uptime in 2020 — less than 15 minutes of downtime during the entire year.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>3. Features that make us feel festive</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>Since Ruby Together launched in 2015, we’ve reached some huge milestones:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n  <li>there are now over 175,000 gems (up from 101,000)</li>\\n  <li>there are over 1,216,000 versions of gems (up from 583,000)</li>\\n  <li>we have served 64 billion (!) gem downloads (up from 4.5 billion in 2015)</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>One of the accomplishments we’re most proud of is designing and shipping the compact index that keeps track of every gem and dependency. It’s been the key to faster installs and updates, as well as ensuring that developers get gem versions that will work with their version of Ruby.</p>\\n\\n<p>At the same time, we migrated all of RubyGems.org to use the Fastly content delivery network, dramatically increasing the speed of downloading gems around the world.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>4. Maintenance, money…and maids</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>A few reasons to be grateful according to our team members — especially if you use Ruby every day:</p>\\n\\n<p>“[Ruby Together] ensures that chores of keeping shared infrastructure up and running is well compensated and the burden of maintaining a shared project doesn’t fall on a single contributor or a company.”</p>\\n\\n<p>“[Ruby Together] seems more like the housemaid of Ruby community to me. It does the work we all agree we need to do but no one wants to do it themselves.”</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>5. Our incredible developer community</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>We’re lucky that developers we’ve connected with in the Ruby Together community are welcoming and inclusive, and we actively work to keep it that way. We have a commitment to only fund projects with a code of conduct. The most popular code of conduct in the Ruby community, the <a href=\\\"https://www.contributor-covenant.org/\\\">Contributor Covenant</a>, was created by Ruby Together board member <a href=\\\"https://github.com/coralineada\\\">Coraline Ada Ehmke</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>We’re cautiously optimistic about what the next year holds. For now, we’re thankful to be able to continue this work and to be a part of your community.</p>\\n\\n<p>(<strong>Extra thanks:</strong> Of course, we can’t let the end of this decade pass without acknowledging 25 years of Ruby  programming language. We’re grateful to Yukihiro Matsumoto and the early developers who help make the language what it is today. The world of open source has transformed in massive ways since then. One thing that hasn’t changed: open source is valuable and open source developers deserve to be compensated for their work.)</p>\\n\\n\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}"},{"title":"November 2020 Monthly Update","status":"published","published_at":1608243540,"mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"html\",{\"cardName\":\"html\",\"html\":\"\\n<p>Hello!

We also fixed a longstanding and frustrating issue where multiple CI builds pushing a new gem version at the same time could result in a checksum error when trying to install the new version.  On June 27, we deprecated the “gem edit” page and it will be removed altogether on July 10.</p>\\n\\n<p>Instead of editing gem metadata at rubygems.org, we recommend using the gem specification itself. Use <code>Gem::Specification#metadata</code> to setting links to a gem’s homepage, changelog, documentation, and other websites. This will help us reduce the complexity of rubygems.org by making <code>Gem::Specification#metadata</code> the single source of truth and it will also allow gem owners to set different URLs by version.</p>\\n\\n<p>This month, rubygems.org saw 28 commits making 159 additions and 74 deletions across 29 files.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"rubygems-news\\\">rubygems news</h2>\\n\\n<p>RubyGems saw a lot of activity this month, with 29 merged pull requests. Changes included some support for the upcoming Ruby 2.7, test improvements, a fix for a leaking tempfile, better support for frozen string literals, and better support for case-insensitive file systems. We also added more deprecations for the upcoming 3.0 release, improved the way RubyGems interacts with Bundler 1.16.2 and the upcoming 2.0, and fixed some edge cases with stub gem specifications.  We shipped most those changes by releasing RubyGems 2.7.7 on June 8.</p>\\n\\n<p>After releasing 2.7.7, we merged several fixes for installing gems directly from an AWS S3 bucket source, improved some warning messages, and fixed issues activating gems when the same gem is installed for more than one platform at once.</p>\\n\\n<p>In total, RubyGems gained 67 new commits, contributed by 12 authors. There were 439 additions and 62 deletions across 24 files.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"gemstash-news\\\">gemstash news</h2>\\n\\n<p>Gemstash saw a bug fix for health check race conditions last month. It gained 2 new commits, contributed by 2 authors. There were 11 additions and 3 deletions across 2 files.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"ruby-toolbox\\\">ruby toolbox</h2>\\n\\n<p>Hey everyone!</p>\\n\\n<p>This month, I prepared the request-for-feedback PR for metric rankings I mentioned in the last update.

I’m currently trying to figure out how to display them best in an \\neasy-to-understand manner—for example, gem download counts are distributed pretty unevenly, with the top 1% gems by downloads count being the reason for ~87% of all gem downloads—so it’s a bit tricky to display a fair and meaningful ranking for “all the other” projects.

I <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/TheDeadSerious/status/979097768177422337\\\">launched them</a> at the end of March and you can see an example <a href=\\\"https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/projects/hanami\\\">here</a>—for instance, you can now see issue and pull request closure rates and recent commit activity.</p>\\n\\n<p>Since I bumped into some minor issues that needed extra work while converting to the new API, I didn’t get much time to spend on the other topic I mentioned in the last update: esier understandability on what the project metrics mean in the greater context of the Ruby ecosystem. Broadly speaking, I’d like to make some clear visual indicators in what range any given metric stands in relation to the Ruby ecosystem to make it easier to “grok” at a glance the healthiness of a project. For example, for gem downloads you could see that a given project is in the 10% most-often-downloaded gems, but for example issue closure rate, release activity and many more can become much more interesting when given this kind of context.</p>\\n\\n<p>This will be my main focus in April, and I hope to have something to show to you in this regard next month. :)</p>\\n\\n<p>As always, your feedback is very welcome.

Four companies joined as new members, including <a href=\\\"https://nebulab.it/\\\">Nebulab</a>, <a href=\\\"https://dev.welaika.com/en/\\\">weLaika</a>, <a href=\\\"http://kickass.partners\\\">Kickass Partners</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>In addition to those companies, 6 new developers signed up as members or friends of Ruby Together, including Stan Lo. In total, we were supported by 91 individual members and 68 friends of Ruby Together. Thanks to all of our members for making everything that we do possible. &lt;3</p>\\n\\n<p>As we mentioned last month, Ruby Together applied to organize a <a href=\\\"https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/\\\">Google Summer of Code 2018</a> project for work on any Ruby open source codebase. In February, Google announced projects, and our application was accepted! 🎉</p>\\n\\n<p>Now that we’ve been accepted, we’re  looking for mentors for students who want to work on Ruby open source projects this summer. For more information about what it’s like to be a mentor, Google has written a <a href=\\\"https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/\\\">mentor guide</a>. If you are interested in mentoring a student this summer, <a href=\\\"mailto:hello@rubytogether.org\\\">get in touch</a>!</p>\\n\\n<p>If you’re a student who’s interested in applying, student applications will open on March 12. For help getting ready to apply, check out the <a href=\\\"https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/\\\">GSoC Student Guide</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>Finally, we would also love contributions to the project ideas list. If you have an open source project or a feature idea that are one-student-summer sized, <a href=\\\"https://github.com/rubygsoc/rubygsoc/wiki/Ideas-List\\\">add them here</a>.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"bundler-news\\\">bundler news</h2>\\n\\n<p>Bundler saw some fixes in February thanks to contributors <a href=\\\"https://github.com/nholden\\\">@nholden</a>, <a href=\\\"https://github.com/voxik\\\">@voxik</a>, <a href=\\\"https://github.com/cpgo\\\">@cpgo</a>,  <a href=\\\"https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez\\\">@deivid-rodriguez</a>, and <a href=\\\"https://github.com/alyssais\\\">@alyssais</a>. Fixes this month included <a href=\\\"https://github.com/bundler/bundler/pull/6288\\\">a fix for certain instances of the “perhaps the lockfile is corrupted?” error</a>, as well as <a href=\\\"https://github.com/bundler/bundler/pull/6283\\\">clear enforcement steps for the code of conduct</a>. We also received <a href=\\\"https://github.com/bundler/rfcs/pull/10\\\">an awesome proposal</a> to give the <code>add</code> command superpowers, and add a <code>remove</code> command.</p>\\n\\n<p>This month, Bundler gained 23 new commits, contributed by 8 authors. There were 291 additions and 59 deletions across 50 files.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"rubygemsorg-news\\\">rubygems.org news</h2>\\n\\n<p>In February, we continued to apply security patches and other updates to the servers running RubyGems.org. We also made progress on a new project, collecting metrics from the server logs about what Ruby, RubyGems, and Bundler versions are being actively used. Hopefully we’ll have something to show everyone next month!</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"rubygems-news\\\">rubygems news</h2>\\n\\n<p>RubyGems saw a lot of activity this month, including the release 2.7.5 and 2.7.6 with <em>tons</em> of bug fixes. The version 2.7.6 release contained some <a href=\\\"https://blog.rubygems.org/2018/02/15/2.7.6-released.html\\\">critical security fixes</a>, and is a strongy recommended upgrade. Get out there and run <code>gem update --system</code> today!</p>\\n\\n<p>On top of releasing new code, we also managed to <a href=\\\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/2202\\\">write out the Ruby version support and release policies</a>, and <a href=\\\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/2182#issuecomment-364631805\\\">draft of a minimally disruptive plan for RubyGems 3 and 4</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>In total, RubyGems gained 130 new commits, contributed by 12 authors. There were 755 additions and 340 deletions across 50 files.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"ruby-toolbox-news\\\">ruby toolbox news</h2>\\n\\n<p>After bringing the Ruby Toolbox back to life at the beginning of February, the rest of the month was mostly about going through a variety of community contributions, mostly related to changes to the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/rubytoolbox/catalog\\\">catalog</a>, which saw 61 pull requests from 43 contributors. I also tried to improve documentation and guidelines for catalog contributions, based on common mistakes happening on that end. The Rails app itself saw a bunch of improvements to the README that now gives an overview of how to get the app running for local development, and in total saw 4 pull requests submitted by 4 contributors.</p>\\n\\n<p>I also did some research and prototyping for charts and statistics that can be gathered from the existing project metrics, and how to make individual project metrics like gem downloads easier to put into context in relation to the rest of the ecosystem. In addition to converting the GitHub gathering to their GraphQL library, thus unlocking a whole bunch of additional project metrics (see <a href=\\\"https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/pull/94\\\">#94</a>), in March I’d like to make daily database dumps available for download to make it easier to get a more realistic development environment, and to bring said project metrics display improvements live for at least one metric to get community feedback on the general approach.</p>\\n\\n<p>As always, your feedback is very welcome, if you have any suggestions or thoughts you’d like to share you can do so via <a href=\\\"https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/issues\\\">GitHub issues</a> or by getting in touch with me directly.</p>\\n\\n<p>Finally, thank you to all of last month’s PR contributors: BookOfGreg, GBH, andyjeffries, brandonweiss, bricesanchez, brodock, btrd, campreb, cedlemo, cyril, dogweather, drgcms, el-feo, emilebosch, eregon, filipewl, florentferry, gzigzigzeo, iridakos, itsderek23, kddeisz, kenn, kirillshevch, konung, lulalala, mediafinger, nilbus, ohler55, olleolleolle, palkan, pat, pboling, pedrozath, philnash, phlegx, pmackay, sacrebleu, sgeorgi, strzibny, tarcieri, tiagoamaro, varyonic, victords, westonganger, zach-capalbo, zoras.</p>\\n\\n<p>See you next month!\\nChristoph</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"budget-amp-expenses\\\">budget &amp; expenses</h2>\\n\\n<p>In February, we paid for 85 hours of developer time, saw $16,380.00 in total income, and spent a total of $16,754.02.</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n  <li>$5,079 for 33.9 hours worked on Bundler at $150/hour</li>\\n  <li>$3,885 for 25.9 hours worked on RubyGems.org at $150/hour</li>\\n  <li>$1,341 for 8.9 hours worked on RubyGems at $150/hour</li>\\n  <li>$2,453 for 16.4 hours worked on other OSS and devtools at $150/hour</li>\\n  <li>$83.61 on dedicated servers for RubyBench.org</li>\\n  <li>$551.98 on payment processing fees</li>\\n  <li>$2,174.03 on company overhead like hosting, services, software, hardware, taxes, etc</li>\\n  <li>$1,050 on accounting, copywriting, design, and other professional services</li>\\n  <li>$136.9 on marketing, evangelism, and community outreach</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>Until next time,<br />\\nStephanie, André and the Ruby Together team</p>\\n\\n\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}"},{"title":"January 2018 Monthly Update","status":"published","published_at":1517443200,"mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"html\",{\"cardName\":\"html\",\"html\":\"\\n\\n<p>Hello, and happy New Year!

It didn’t happen in 2017, but in 2016 we were able to run a Google Summer of Code project for any Ruby codebase. With around a dozen students working on MRI, Bundler, RubyGems, and other projects, it was very exciting. Hopefully we’ll have a summer of students working on Ruby OSS in 2018 as well.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"bundler-news\\\">bundler news</h2>\\n\\n<p>Bundler saw a over a dozen bugfixes in January, thanks to contributors including <a href=\\\"https://www.github.com/KrauseFx\\\">@KrauseFx</a>, <a href=\\\"https://github.com/akhramov\\\">@akhramov</a>, <a href=\\\"https://github.com/christhekeele\\\">@christhekeele</a>, <a href=\\\"https://github.com/joelvh\\\">@joelvh</a>, and <a href=\\\"https://github.com/ajwann\\\">@ajwann</a>.

As I was chugging along on getting the site ready for launch, these tiny things that I wanted to be part of the initial relaunch kept coming up, and ultimately the site relaunched with quite a few things I had lined up for post-launch in the last update—the most notable of them being search—which is now already available.</p>\\n\\n<p>Still, this is only a starting point. You can find the work lined up for the next few weeks on the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/projects/1\\\">GitHub project</a>, and as feedback from users starts pouring in, I’m sure there will be more.</p>\\n\\n<p>On top of that, one of the main aspects I want to focus on in the next month is cleaning up the catalog; some categorizations are plain wrong, and some categories may be obsolete by now. I recently also did some <a href=\\\"https://github.com/rubytoolbox/rubytoolbox/pull/94\\\">research into using GitHub’s new GraphQL API</a>, and want to convert to it as it will unlock plenty of additional metrics that could be added to the site without hitting API rate limiting issues.</p>\\n\\n<p>See you next month! \\nBest,\\nChristoph</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"budget-amp-expenses\\\">budget &amp; expenses</h2>\\n\\n<p>In January, we paid for 105 hours of developer time, saw $18,920.00 in total income, and spent a total of $20,234.17.</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n  <li>$7,335 for 48.9 hours worked on Bundler at $150/hour</li>\\n  <li>$4,286 for 28.6 hours worked on RubyGems.org at $150/hour</li>\\n  <li>$1,594 for 10.6 hours worked on RubyGems at $150/hour</li>\\n  <li>$2,583 for 17.2 hours worked on other OSS and devtools at $150/hour</li>\\n  <li>$79.87 on dedicated servers for RubyBench.org</li>\\n  <li>$625.94 on payment processing fees</li>\\n  <li>$2,430.69 on company overhead like hosting, services, software, hardware, taxes, etc</li>\\n  <li>$800.00 on accounting, copywriting, design, and other professional services</li>\\n  <li>$500.00 on marketing, evangelism, and community outreach</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>Until next time,<br />\\nStephanie, André and the Ruby Together team</p>\\n\\n\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}"},{"title":"December Monthly and 2017 Yearly Update","status":"published","published_at":1515283200,"mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"html\",{\"cardName\":\"html\",\"html\":\"\\n\\n<p>Hello, and welcome to a year-end special edition of the monthly update: Ruby Together’s Yearly Update for 2017!

The Ruby language core team has yet to announce why they decided to remove Bundler a few hours before Ruby 2.5 was released on Christmas Day. Hopefully, we’ll find out the story there soon.</p>\\n\\n<p>In the meantime, Bundler 1.16.1 has been released, with fixes or workarounds for all known issues. If you were waiting to upgrade to version 1.16, give it a try now! If you’re still seeing issues on version 1.16.1, please <a href=\\\"https://github.com/bundler/bundler/blob/master/ISSUES.md\\\">let us know!</a> We care a lot about fixing bugs and maintaining backwards compatibility, but we need to hear from users in order to know when bugs have crept in. &lt;3</p>\\n\\n<p>In December, Bundler gained 59 new commits, contributed by 8 authors.

The biggest change was the start of merging Bundler and RubyGems into a single gem manager to rule them all. We plan to continue that work in the coming year, in addition to fixing bugs, staving off bitrot, and working to improve the RubyGems experience for everyone.</p>\\n\\n<p>In 2017, we shipped 11 releases total, with one new feature release. Those releases included 463 commits, by 25 authors, with 3,655 additions and 1,144 deletions across 122 files.</p>\\n\\n<p>We especially want to thank the new contributors to RubyGems in 2017: Alyssa Ross, anantkolvankar, Arthur Marzinkovskiy, Colby Swandale, EdOverflow, Grey Baker, HorimotoYasuhiro, Jared Beck, Jason Frey, Jonathan Claudius, Jun Aruga, Kazuaki Matsuo, Mark Sayson, Olle Jonsson, Shiva Bhusal, toru.yagi, and Tsukuru Tanimichi.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"rubygemsorg-news\\\">RubyGems.org news</h3>\\n\\n<p>Through a combination of luck, hard work, and frequent security patches, RubyGems.org avoided significant downtime during 2017. The two most exciting events were probably <a href=\\\"http://blog.rubygems.org/2017/10/09/unsafe-object-deserialization-vulnerability.html\\\">discovering our years-old remote execution vulnerability was not completely fixed</a>, and scrambling to truly fix it once and for all. Thanks to David Radcliffe and Aaron Patterson for their work to implement and test a new fix. On top of that, we got to defend against a denial of service attack that overwhelmed our backend servers—on Christmas Day itself. Huge props to David Radcliffe and Evan Phoenix, who saved Christmas for Ruby devs around the world while demonstrating awesome teamwork between Ruby Central and Ruby Together.</p>\\n\\n<p>In 2017, RubyGems.org merged 336 commits by 30 authors, with 4,880 additions and 3,005 deletions across 320 files.</p>\\n\\n<p>We especially want to thank the new contributors to RubyGems.org in 2017:  Aaron Patterson, Andre Medeiros, Colby Swandale, Olle Jonsson, Shota Miyazaki, siddhantBajaj, and Yoshiyuki Hirano.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"gemstash-news\\\">Gemstash news</h3>\\n\\n<p>Gemstash had a pretty calm 2017, seeing some general bugfixes and enhancements but no significant activity. If you’re looking for a way to get started contributing to Ruby open source, the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/bundler/gemstash/issues\\\">Gemstash issues list</a> has several bugs and feature requests that would make a good starting point.</p>\\n\\n<p>In 2017, Gemstash merged 75 commits by 10 authors, with 610 additions and 456 deletions across 47 files. We especially want to thank the new contributors to Gemstash in 2017: Agis Anastasopoulos, and Omer Katz.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"ruby-toolbox-news\\\">Ruby Toolbox news</h3>\\n\\n<p>Hello everyone,</p>\\n\\n<p>Happy new year! Holiday season was a bit involved for me, so unfortunately I didn’t find time to work on the new Toolbox in December — that obviously also meant that the planned mid-December launch that I mentioned in the last update didn’t work out — sorry for that! Sometimes you just have to cut some stuff — I actually sat down a few evenings to do some work, but quickly realized I was simply too tired to do anything meaningful.</p>\\n\\n<p>That being said, the new year is off to a good start: Import of RubyGems and GitHub stats are ready, so after adding score calculations and a bit of UI polish, the site should finally come back in the next week or two. In contrast to the last update, this will actually already include <strong>all</strong> gems, not only those in categories, and the syncing already includes a good chunk of the metrics on the old site, so adding them to the site will only mean adding them to the UI, so those should become visible pretty soon as well.</p>\\n\\n<p>After the site is launched the first thing to do will be adding good full text search. I will also prepare some “future ideas” and “easy first contribution” tickets on Github after launch, so everyone interested in contributing get a chance to do so, but first I want this website live :)</p>\\n\\n<p>As mentioned last month, you can find the current state of the site at <a href=\\\"https://beta.ruby-toolbox.com\\\">beta.ruby-toolbox.com</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>Thanks for your time, see you next month!</p>\\n\\n<p>— Christoph</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"december-budget-and-finances\\\">December budget and finances</h3>\\n\\n<p>In December, we took in a total of $18,115.0, and spent a total of $19,475.62.

Welcome to the monthly update for Ruby Together, a non-profit trade association dedicated to maintaining and improving developer tools for the Ruby programming language.</p>\\n\\n<p>During the month of July, we released two bugfix versions of Bundler, planned for the future, and made progress towards keeping RubyGems.org working for the months and years to come. Read on for more details!</p>\\n\\n<p>Last month, our work was supported by <a href=\\\"http://stripe.com/\\\">Stripe</a>, <a href=\\\"http://gitlab.com/\\\">Gitlab</a>, <a href=\\\"http://cloudcity.io\\\">Cloud City</a>, <a href=\\\"http://digitalocean.com/\\\">Digital Ocean</a>, <a href=\\\"http://www.bleacherreport.com/\\\">Bleacher Report</a>, and <a href=\\\"http://rubytogether.org/join\\\">viewers like you</a>.<br />\\nIf you’re not a member yet, you can learn more and help support our work at <a href=\\\"https://rubytogether.org\\\">rubytogether.org</a>.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"ruby-together-news\\\">ruby together news</h2>\\n\\n<p>It was pretty quiet on the Ruby Together front—no new hires, but lots of ongoing work to make using Ruby easier and more reliable.</p>\\n\\n<p>In July, Ruby Together was supported by 79 different companies, including Sapphire member <a href=\\\"https://stripe.com\\\">Stripe</a>. On top of those companies, 1 new developer signed up a friend of Ruby Together, Josh Justice.</p>\\n\\n<p>In total, we were supported by 109 individual members and 72 friends of Ruby Together last month. Thanks to all of our members for making everything that we do possible. &lt;3</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"bundler-news\\\">bundler news</h2>\\n\\n<p>A lot happened with Bundler in July! We released two bugfix versions of Bundler, version <a href=\\\"https://github.com/bundler/bundler/blob/v1.15.3/CHANGELOG.md#1152-2017-07-17\\\">1.15.2</a> and version <a href=\\\"https://github.com/bundler/bundler/blob/v1.15.3/CHANGELOG.md#1153-2017-07-21\\\">1.15.3</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>In addition to industriously fixing bugs, the indomitable <a href=\\\"https://github.com/segiddins\\\">@segiddins</a> has been working full-time over the summer towards Bundler 2.0. We made significant progress: the test suite now runs (and passes!) with all 2.0 feature flags turned on, and it is possible to build and install a development version of Bundler 2. Our next steps will be wrapping up the expected changes, and then testing and smoothing the path to migrate from version 1.x to version 2.</p>\\n\\n<p>Even though Bundler 2 will contain changes to default settings and command options, it’s incredibly important to us that all existing projects continue to work without breaking, and that each individual application can choose to switch from Bundler 1 to Bundler 2 at a time that’s best for them.</p>\\n\\n<p>In addition to the work on 2.0, there were two new RFC proposals. RFCs are detailed writeups of potential changes, describing those changes in a way that can be evaluated and discussed before implementation work starts. The two new RFCs in July were:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n  <li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/bundler/rfcs/blob/aa-deploy-command/text/0000-bundle-deploy-command.md\\\">Add a <code>bundle deploy</code> command</a></li>\\n  <li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/bundler/rfcs/blob/49e08ccf04579a92c394e438074ca7e277d036f5/text/0000-bundle-groups.md\\\">Add a <code>bundle groups</code> command</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>If you’re interested in the way that Bundler handles deploys or gem groups, we’d love to hear your feedback on the open proposals.</p>\\n\\n<p>Finally, a special thanks to the new contributors to Bundler in the month of July:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n  <li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/arbonap\\\">arbonap</a></li>\\n  <li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez\\\">deivid-rodriguez</a></li>\\n  <li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/greysteil\\\">greysteil</a></li>\\n  <li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/koic\\\">koic</a></li>\\n  <li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/NickLaMuro\\\">NickLaMuro</a></li>\\n  <li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/roberts1000\\\">roberts1000</a></li>\\n  <li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/rubymorillo\\\">rubymorillo</a></li>\\n  <li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/stefansedich\\\">stefansedich</a></li>\\n  <li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/xxx\\\">xxx</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>In total, Bundler gained 160 new commits, contributed by 14 authors. There were 7,101 additions and 1,381 deletions across 805 files.</p>\\n\\n<p>Thanks for your hard work, everyone!</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"rubygemsorg-news\\\">rubygems.org news</h2>\\n\\n<p>This month was quieter for RubyGems.org, but we did regular maintenance, installed security updates, and generally kept everything running. Most of the time that we spent this month was work on an in-progress SSL troubleshooting guide.</p>\\n\\n<p>Next year, we’ll be migrating RubyGems.org to require TLS v1.2 or newer, which is why we’re focused on writing and shipping an excellent troubleshooting and upgrade guide before that happens. When the guide is finished, it will be a fantastic resource for anyone having trouble with HTTPS connections from Ruby.</p>\\n\\n<p>Merged features included dependency updates, copy fixes, and a security fix of throttling requests to change or delete user profiles. Overall, Rubygems.org gained 23 new commits, contributed by 4 authors. There were 84 additions and 66 deletions across 20 files.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"rubygems-news\\\">rubygems news</h2>\\n\\n<p>RubyGems saw some small changes and documentation updates, but stayed pretty stable. We’ve started working with ruby-core team member <a href=\\\"https://github.com/hsbt\\\">@hsbt</a> on getting RubyGems and Bundler to be tested together as part of the Ruby build. Once that is done, it should be much harder for changes to Ruby to break anything inside RubyGems or Bundler, which will be a huge help.</p>\\n\\n<p>This month, Rubygems gained 29 new commits, contributed by 7 authors. There were 348 additions and 102 deletions across 23 files.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"gemstash-news\\\">gemstash news</h2>\\n\\n<p>Gemstash didn’t see any new features this month, but we did finally release <a href=\\\"https://github.com/bundler/gemstash/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#110-2017-07-31\\\">version 1.1.0</a>. Along with adding MySQL support, Gemstash now supports <code>gem install</code>, as well as <a href=\\\"https://github.com/bundler/gemstash/blob/master/docs/gemstash-private-gems.7.md#protected-fetching\\\">protected fetching</a> for hosting completely private gems that are only available to authorized users.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"budget-amp-expenses\\\">budget &amp; expenses</h2>\\n\\n<p>In July, we saw $43,114.34 in total income, and spent a total of $25,303.55.</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n  <li>$9,109 for 60.7 hours worked on Bundler at $150/hour</li>\\n  <li>$8,396 for 56 hours worked on RubyGems.org at $150/hour</li>\\n  <li>$900 for 6 hours worked on RubyGems at $150/hour</li>\\n  <li>$3,000 for 20 hours worked on other OSS and devtools at $150/hour</li>\\n  <li>$76.11 on dedicated servers for RubyBench.org</li>\\n  <li>$639.20 on payment processing fees</li>\\n  <li>$2,339.50 on company overhead like hosting, services, software, hardware, taxes, etc</li>\\n  <li>$470 on accounting, copywriting, design, and other professional services</li>\\n  <li>$373.74 on marketing, evangelism, and community outreach</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>Until next time,<br />\\nAndré and the Ruby Together team</p>\\n\\n\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}"},{"title":"March 2020 Monthly Update","status":"published","published_at":1585785600,"mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"html\",{\"cardName\":\"html\",\"html\":\"\\n\\n<p>Hello!

It’s been a long time since we posted an update. Some overwhelming life events happened, and I prioritized keeping the open source work happening over writing updates every month. And now it’s a global pandemic, which is not exactly un-overwhelming.</p>\\n\\n  <p>Trying to backfill everything that happened would be a herculean task, so we’ll have to summarize: in 2019, Ruby Together paid open source developers $233,000 for over 1,550 hours of Ruby open source development and maintenance work. Those hours were spread across Bundler, RubyGems, RubyGems.org, Gemstash, the Ruby Toolbox, BridgeTroll, SimpleCov, and other projects. We also ran a session of RubyMe, spending $16,200 to ensure 6 pairs of mentors and apprentices could work together on various Ruby open source projects for 12 weeks. Now that we’ve summarized 2019, we’ll have a full update for the last month and then try to keep up from here on out.</p>\\n\\n  <p>The good news is that we’ve got new additions to the team to keep the updates flowing, which should make them significantly more consistent. A very enthusiastic welcome is due to Irene Kannyo and Gift Egwuenu, who will be helping with content/copywriting and technical writing, respectively.</p>\\n\\n  <p>— André</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>Since our last update, Ruby Together was supported by 46 different companies, including Ruby members <a href=\\\"https://stripe.com\\\">Stripe</a> and <a href=\\\"https://handshake.org\\\">Handshake</a>. In that time, 4 other companies joined as new members.</p>\\n\\n<p>On top of those companies, 26 new developers signed up as members, including Matt Sias, Ollie Bennett, @MikeRogers0, Mike Boone, Crawford Wynnes, Philip Arndt, Jimmy Chu, Tobias Pfeiffer, Thomas Powell, Shupport, Brandon Weaver, Michelle Ng SY, Pascal Wengerter, David Revelo, Michael Verret Jr, and Jared White. In total, we were supported by 108 developer members. Thanks to all of our members for making everything that we do possible. &lt;3</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"ruby-me-news\\\">ruby me news</h2>\\n\\n<p>Although our last RubyMe session wasn’t in March, we wanted to highlight our successful RubyMe session during 2019. We received almost 100 applications from prospective apprentices and about a dozen applications from prospective mentors. Our budget let us accept six mentor/apprentice pairs, and each pair worked together for 12 weeks between May and August 2019. They were able to contribute to several Ruby open source projects including <a href=\\\"https://rubyonrails.org\\\">Ruby on Rails</a>, <a href=\\\"\\\">If-me</a>, <a href=\\\"\\\">Dev.to</a>, <a href=\\\"\\\">Homebrew</a>, <a href=\\\"\\\">Gemstash</a>, and <a href=\\\"\\\">Babywearing</a> from <a href=\\\"\\\">Ruby for Good</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>We’re proud to report that two of our mentees landed jobs shortly after the session closed. Congrats to both of them!</p>\\n\\n<p>If you want to know right away next time we’re able to open applications, sign up for our RubyMe-only newsletter at <a href=\\\"https://rubyme.org\\\">rubyme.org</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>Future RubyMe sessions will happen as often as we are able to set aside budget for them, but current circumstances mean we’re not sure how soon that will be. If your company would be interested in sponsoring our next RubyMe session, please <a href=\\\"mailto:hello+rubymesponsor@rubytogether.org\\\">get in touch</a>!</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"google-summer-of-code-news\\\">google summer of code news</h2>\\n\\n<p>Google Summer of Code is upon us again, and this year the inimitable volunteers <a href=\\\"https://github.com/hmistry\\\">@hiren</a> and <a href=\\\"https://github.com/zoras\\\">@zoras</a> have stepped up from mentoring last year to running the program this year. Ruby Together is less directly involved, but is still providing advice, backup administrators, and mentorship for some student projects. Students have finished applying, and the selection process is currently ongoing. We’re excited to see what they’re able to accomplish this summer!</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"bundler-news\\\">bundler news</h2>\\n\\n<p>Amazingly, all that work that the entire Bundler and RubyGems teams have been working at for years has paid off in a really big way: Bundler and RubyGems have merged repositories! On GitHub, <code>bundler/bundler</code> is archived, and all ongoing work on both projects now takes place inside <code>RubyGems/RubyGems</code>. All other repositories from the Bundler organization have either been archived (if unused) or moved to the RubyGems organization.</p>\\n\\n<p>Not just the repositories have changed, either: the Bundler and RubyGems teams have merged as well. It’ll take us some time to work through 20 years worth of documentation and webpages, but we’ll be combining and updating them as fast as we can.</p>\\n\\n<p>From this point forward, Bundler news will be reported together with RubyGems news. Hooray! 🎉</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"rubygems-news\\\">rubygems news</h2>\\n\\n<p>As mentioned above, the huge news is that Bundler merged into RubyGems! Major props to @hsbt for sending the PR to combine repositories, as well as @deivid-rodruiguez for helping troubleshoot, fix CI, and get the PR landed.</p>\\n\\n<p>On top of that huge accomplishment, RubyGems saw ongoing maintenance and bugfixes, improved tests on JRuby, better deprecation warnings, and fixes for the internal bot that labels PRs and issues. The RubyGems team spent time to get more familiar with newly imported Bundler issues, and the Bundler team spent time getting more familiar with RubyGems, as well as the usual PR review and issue triage.</p>\\n\\n<p>In March, RubyGems gained <a href=\\\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/compare/master@%7B2020-03-01%7D...master@%7B2020-03-31%7D\\\">more than 10,000 new commits</a> (which includes all of Bundler’s history!) contributed by 21 authors. There were 96,617 additions and 961 deletions across 1,423 files.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"rubygemsorg-news\\\">rubygems.org news</h2>\\n\\n<p>In March, thanks to Aditya and Colby we were able to update most of our gem dependencies, which included a security release to Rails. Additionally, he helped us fix the incorrect rate limit on the gem push endpoint. This should be a big improvement for users with high release volume like AWS, which publishes hundreds of gems every time they update <code>aws-sdk</code>. We also resolved some related rate limit issues with multi-factor authentication.</p>\\n\\n<p>To mitigate against typo-squatting, we were previously maintaining a protected list of gem names using the Levenshtein distance. Unfortunately, the check turned out to be too strict, and caused more problems than it was solving. We have disabled it for now, and we are looking into other ways to deal with typo-squatting. Thank you for bearing with us while we figure this out.</p>\\n\\n<p>Aditya was also able to complete a grab bag of other useful work, including:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n  <li>revisit adoptions PR/issues</li>\\n  <li>help a gsoc student write RFC for the ownership changes <a href=\\\"https://github.com/rubygems/rfcs/issues/25\\\">rubygems/rfcs#25</a></li>\\n  <li>fix incorrect backoff on mfa endpoints beside gem push <a href=\\\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/issues/2270\\\">rubygems/rubygems.org#2270</a></li>\\n  <li>PR to migrate nginx to sidecar in staging deployment <a href=\\\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/issues/2291\\\">rubygems/rubygems.org#2291</a></li>\\n  <li>PR to support prefix match <a href=\\\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/issues/2308\\\">rubygems/rubygems.org#2308</a></li>\\n  <li>PRs to fix several open issues <a href=\\\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/issues/2315\\\">rubygems/rubygems.org#2315</a>, <a href=\\\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/issues/2316\\\">#2316</a>, <a href=\\\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/issues/2317\\\">#2317</a>.</li>\\n  <li>debug 429 for info endpoint on nginx</li>\\n  <li>debug partial requests being logged as not cacheable by fastly</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>For the month, RubyGems.org received <a href=\\\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/compare/master@%7B2020-03-01%7D...master@%7B2020-03-31%7D\\\">80 commits</a> from 6 authors, who made 294 additions and 206 deletions across 17 files.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"ruby-toolbox-news\\\">ruby toolbox news</h2>\\n\\n<p>Hey everyone,</p>\\n\\n<p>last month I wrapped up and launched an API for Ruby Toolbox which allows you to query project data.

Having been a Ruby developer for nearly 15 years, this represents a truly exciting opportunity to give back to the community and be a part of a meaningful organization. But the first question I had to figure out was, why grow? Ruby Together has nearly 200 members, which is a great start. Our current membership base allows us to make critical security and bug fixes to RubyGems and Bundler, as well as fund mentorship programs and grants for open source Ruby software.</p>\\n\\n<p>The obvious answer is more members means more resources to improve Ruby projects. But the less obvious answers are also exciting and represent a transformative opportunity for the future of Ruby and our community. So I hope you will join me as I share why Ruby Together is so important, what we have accomplished, and what the future holds.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"why-is-ruby-together-important\\\">Why is Ruby Together important?</h2>\\n\\n<p>Bundler, RubyGems, and the Ruby Toolbox, the primary open source projects supported by Ruby Together, are used tens of billions of times a year. Bundler and RubyGems make up not just the most important pieces of Ruby infrastructure, but also serve as critical tools for millions of sites across the internet. Without the support of our members, we would not be able to hire developers to make improvements to these tools and reliably keep them secure. By ensuring these services remain stable, Ruby Together helps foster a diverse ecosystem of open source libraries, plugins, and repositories able to coexist among multiple Ruby, gem, and code versions.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Ruby language is also deeply intertwined with open source software. The language is open source, its most popular libraries are open source, and by and large, Ruby developers contribute greatly to open source projects. Traditionally, open source has been maintained by volunteers. While a net positive, this can pose some disadvantages, including lack of documentation, technical support, sustainability, and timely security fixes. Ruby Together was created to solve these problems by financially supporting open source maintainers, ensuring the long term success, security, and stability of the Ruby ecosystem.</p>\\n\\n<p>As the Ruby community has grown and matured, Ruby Together has played an essential role in ensuring the long term stability of core Ruby projects by paying developers, thereby avoiding having to rely  solely on volunteers. Bundler and RubyGems.org continue to serve billions of additional requests each year, making volunteer support unsustainable. Since our inception, Ruby Together has paid for over 5,000 hours of open source developer work, as well as advocated for the professional advancement of our members, and encouraged the next generation of Ruby developers by creating a welcoming and inclusive community through grant and mentorship opportunities.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"what-else-have-we-accomplished\\\">What else have we accomplished?</h2>\\n\\n<p>In addition to funding thousands of hours of improvements to Bundler, RubyGems, RubyGems.org, Gemstash and more, it is important to  highlight some of the other outreach and impactful work Ruby Together does for the community.</p>\\n\\n<p>Ruby Together <a href=\\\"https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/blog/2018-02-01/lets-push-things-forward\\\">helped resurrect</a> the <a href=\\\"https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/\\\">Ruby Toolbox</a>, a comprehensive resource for developers to find maintained and popular open source Ruby libraries. The Ruby Toolbox has been one of my favorite resources over the years and recently <a href=\\\"https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/blog/2019-05-01/time-flies\\\">turned 10 years old</a>! Our funding has helped the site’s creator, <a href=\\\"http://olszowka.de/\\\">Christoph Olszowka</a>, to maintain, open source, and redesign the site, as well as keep the data and projects up to date. Great work Christoph!</p>\\n\\n<p>Ruby Together also <a href=\\\"https://rubytogether.org/news/2018-09-18-announcing-ruby-me\\\">recently launched RubyMe</a>, a mentorship program to help early-career developers improve their skills and confidence by contributing to Ruby projects, paying both mentor and mentee to pair program on open source software for 8 hours per month.

It’s going to be part of every future job. — Rachel Ober</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://research.hackerrank.com/student-developer/2018\\\">Over 65% of new developers are self-taught</a>. Rachel Ober is not part of that statistic. She’s among the surprising minority who learned to code in school, dual majoring in computer science and psychology—a compelling combination driven by a desire to learn how people think when they’re using computer systems.</p>\\n\\n<p>Early in her career Rachel became interested in the front end of Ruby on Rails, and during that time she became involved with volunteer-run <a href=\\\"http://railsbridge.org/\\\">RailsBridge</a>, started by Sarah Allen and Sarah Mei. Their mission was bold and much needed: make it easier for people to learn Ruby on Rails in a welcoming and accessible environment. Even if somebody had never programmed, there was a place for them and a curriculum for absolute newbies.</p>\\n\\n<p>The free workshops, still active today, go as far as to offer free childcare. Rachel recalls an entire family, grandmother included, driving from New Jersey to New York City on a Friday night to attend a weekend workshop. RailsBridge started as a grassroots initiative in 2009 targeting an underserved community and continues going strong with “events focused on increasing diversity in tech, so that people of all backgrounds can feel welcome and comfortable in the industry.”</p>\\n\\n<p>In 2013, Rachel discovered a passion for teaching after being invited to develop General Assembly’s first Ruby on Rails course. The opportunity allowed her to experiment with teaching techniques to see what worked with new and experienced Ruby on Rails students. Tech was moving into New York City more and a lot of people interested in Ruby on Rails were expressing that it was hard to get started. All the dots started connecting and Rachel set off on a course to bring more Ruby on Rails workshops to New York City.</p>\\n\\n<p>It was through this experience that <a href=\\\"https://www.bridgetroll.org/events\\\">Bridge Troll</a> was born as an event management tool for all of <a href=\\\"https://bridgefoundry.org/\\\">Bridge Foundry</a>’s Bridge communities. The function is to make it easier to surface novice to advanced workshops happening around the world so that more people can learn to code. “I found out about Ruby Together through Twitter and learned that the organization funded open source projects.</p>\\n\\n<p>For Bridge Troll to happen, I needed funding to support the time I would dedicate to working on the tool, so I put an application together and made a case for it.” With her proposal reviewed and accepted by the Ruby Together board, Rachel shares updates on where Bridge Troll is today after four weeks into the Ruby Together program.</p>\\n\\n<h4 id=\\\"update-1\\\">Update #1</h4>\\n\\n<p>Our first two weeks managing the Bridge Troll project were basically figuring out the scope of the Bridge Troll project!</p>\\n\\n<p>To give some history, Bridge Troll was created in order to make it easier to surface workshops that were happening around the world.</p>\\n\\n<p>All of our bridges are entirely volunteer-run and largely run independently from each other. This leads to flexibility, but what can occur is that organizers can feel lost or worse that there is no one else in the organization available to help them with their needs.</p>\\n\\n<p>Unfortunately, this real-world reality is often reflected in the code base of Bridge Troll itself!</p>\\n\\n<p>Bridge Troll was originally led by a core team of individuals who have rolled off the project over the years without finding a replacement core team to pick up the reins and lead development of features and manage bugs. Because the application had certain quirks originally meant just for RailsBridge and a USA-based workshop, we now run into problems where not all of our Bridge workshops are recorded in this important piece of software.</p>\\n\\n<p>After many discussions with Sarah Allen on this subject, our first objective, and quite possibly the only objective of this project that we will likely focus on, is to create processes and lines of communication so that by the end of the 12 weeks we will have a new core team of contributors who will be set up for success to support the application and support new contributors who would like to help us out with the development.</p>\\n\\n<p>My first objective for this 2-week period was to get introductions to the previous core contributors and begin conversations with those on the different program Boards for the different Bridge sub-organizations.</p>\\n\\n<p>My second objective was to start documenting everything that I was working on, this included:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n  <li>Development log: to track what I was working on to report to Ruby Together</li>\\n  <li>Program Board: this can include daily updates of new files I created or documentation for the project or investigations into bugs that came in that I could triage right away.</li>\\n  <li>Communication log: to document who I was reaching out to and what decisions had been made</li>\\n  <li>Ongoing Questions file: if I had a conversation with someone and they ask something like “How do I get access to x?” and if I didn’t know how to answer that, I would add it to this file so that we could create the proper process to get people access.</li>\\n  <li>User Interview questions: as I began to schedule a time to talk to contributors and stakeholders, I wanted to make sure I was consistent in what I was asking them but also had two different paths depending on who I was talking to.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>Contributors were those who worked in the internals of the Bridge Troll code base and know the history of why things are the way they are.</p>\\n\\n<p>Program board members and workshop organizers were users of the application itself. I want to find out more where Bridge Troll is excelling as a tool but also failing to provide the support for running workshops.</p>\\n\\n<p>There is a lot of work to be done on the project and most of it is just finding out what is the most important thing to focus on first!</p>\\n\\n<p>Sarah Allen and I have regular weekly meetings set up to track progress and bounce ideas off of each other as I work through creating processes and triage bug issues over the next few weeks!</p>\\n\\n<h4 id=\\\"update-2\\\">Update #2</h4>\\n\\n<p>Our second two-week batch of work focused on triage of new bugs, setting up more communication channels between code contributors, board members, and Bridge Troll users, and a deep look into the <a href=\\\"https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/programs/badge-program/\\\">Core Infrastructure Badge Program</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p><em>Triage of bugs</em></p>\\n\\n<p>One issue that constantly comes up is who has the permissions to approve new workshops on Bridge Troll? This is a question that spans both the core contributors (how exactly does someone get permission via the code base?) and the board members (which people get permission to approve events?)</p>\\n\\n<p>The code base currently lets those who are bridge leaders, e.g. someone who is on the board, to approve events. But if that person is unresponsive—we have had issues where workshops have gone weeks without being approved—this can affect anything from attendance levels —because the workshop isn’t published on the platform—to the workshop’s organizers ability to get sponsorship funding because they can’t prove to the sponsor that the event is actually happening.</p>\\n\\n<p>After a conversation with a past core contributor, we found that we could only add new admins via a Heroku console command and made a ticket to create an admin panel in Bridge Troll itself to better facilitate this action in the future. Additionally, we added 3 new admins (including myself, another core contributor, and a board member) to pick up the slack to approve new workshops.</p>\\n\\n<p>We also recognized that the emails we send out to those who can approve workshops are ambiguous at best. The email itself does not have a clear “call to action” to say how to approve or what qualifications an event should have before approval. So that too was added to the backlog of things to address including a look into all of the emails we send!</p>\\n\\n<p><em>Core Infrastructure Badge Program</em></p>\\n\\n<p>I started to look into this after a conversation with Sarah Allen. Her feeling was that this program was a great first step to address the different parts of what a “successful” open source project includes in its documentation. I took a working session to run Bridge Troll through their system and set up a <a href=\\\"https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/projects/2769/\\\">public project status page</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>Going through each of these benchmarks is a time-consuming ordeal and even after I went through it independently, I needed to also speak to Sarah about this and ask more detailed questions about whether we hit the criteria, could do better at hitting the criteria or didn’t hit it at all. We definitely were better at certain sections than others, but unfortunately, we didn’t make it through the entire document in one sitting and will have to revisit it again.</p>\\n\\n<p><em>Top Hit List</em></p>\\n\\n<p>This session we also started to develop our most important hit list of items that we felt could make the biggest impact in addition to the Core Infrastructure Badge Program that would help show potential contributors that the project was active and looking for contribution. I started investigating the way we display dates and times on the site (which ended up being quite varied!) and caused confusion to our international workshop organizers and attendees.</p>\\n\\n<p class=\\\"small\\\">Stay tuned for more updates on the 12-week Bridge Troll project.

The California native studied political science and anthropology in college and then made the move to Washington DC to pursue a career on The Hill. After a few jobs—with a think tank, a bank, and an NGO—she learned of an opportunity thanks to <a href=\\\"https://www.womenwhocode.com/\\\">Women Who Code</a> DC, where other women her age or younger were problem-solving and gaining financial independence through careers in software development.</p>\\n\\n<p>Ready for the career change, <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/OptimistAlicia\\\">Alicia</a> dropped everything, enlisted in a coding bootcamp, moved from DC to Atlanta, and started her dedicated journey into programming. Since she started learning, her goal has always been to land a full time role as a software engineer. Today, Alicia works as a Support Software Engineer at SalesLoft and has recently been accepted into Ruby Me, a paid mentorship program created by Ruby Together giving early-career Ruby developers the opportunity to build up professional development experience by contributing to open source projects with the help of a mentor. We chatted with her about the lessons learned and what it takes to make it in programming.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Ruby Together: Can you describe your experience with Ruby Me?</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>Jumping into open source can be intimidating, Ruby Me has given me the confidence and paid opportunity to get my feet wet. After I left DC, I got in touch with the Women Who Code chapter in Atlanta. A friend of mine there saw the Ruby Me apprentice opportunity and I applied. The process was straightforward and when I received the great news that I’d been accepted, it was one of my proudest moments.</p>\\n\\n<p>My mentor, <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/JuanCrg90\\\">Juan C. Ruiz</a>, is based in Mexico and we talk once per week. We have a good rhythm—create an action plan, execute, and then write a follow up report. I’ve submitted my first pull request and realized success here isn’t only measured through the number of PRs, but also the learning you gain by working through the obstacles.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>RT: What are you hoping to gain from this experience?</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>I’m really looking forward to making contributions to the Ruby open source community. I’m also looking to grow confidence and use what I learn to help me land a full-time software engineering role.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>RT: What advice would you offer someone who’s considering jumping careers and getting into learning Ruby?</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>A friend of mine, Ray Gesualdo, reminded me, “don’t go solo, self-taught is really community taught.” While you’re on this path, people will lend their knowledge to help you. For example, the Women Who Code community has been my strongest and most helpful ally. I found the local chapter in Atlanta to be supportive of my learning and amazing at helping me find opportunities like Ruby Me and SalesLoft.</p>\\n\\n<p>I think it’s also wise to identify the job and company that you want and then work backwards from the skillsets. When you approach this field, it can be like, “learn everything, learn it well,” and that can be inefficient.</p>\\n\\n<p>In terms of access to educational content, there are a lot of resources online. It certainly helps, but it isn’t essential to enroll in a coding bootcamp. Just be ready to put in the work. Finding a company to hire you right out of the bootcamp can be challenging, but there are also those who are jumping right out of bootcamp into a full time job.</p>\\n\\n<p>Learning to code requires discipline, so don’t give up and keep working at it. Take feedback from people who are successful in this field and those you admire. It’s so helpful to have a community of people behind you; you’ll definitely need it. The Atlanta Women Who Code organization put me in front of my internship, the support engineer role I have today, and also the Ruby Me opportunity. They essentially helped put me on the radar.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>About Ruby Me</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>Ruby Me is a three-month long paid mentorship program where early-career developers (with a firm grasp of Ruby fundamentals) get matched with experienced Ruby developers to work on an open source project of their choice.

Not only is that way easier to understand, it means everyone who contributes is now a member! All existing members have been migrated to one of the new levels, but will continue to pay the old price for as long as they keep their membership active.</p>\\n\\n<p>This is just the first step of our work to provide more benefits for members, so keep an eye on future updates for more. 🙂</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"bundler-news\\\">bundler news</h2>\\n\\n<p>Bundler saw some great maintenance and testing improvements, including fixes for running the tests on Azure pipelines (which will mean running the Bundler tests on Windows!), as well as test order randomization to ensure no tests depend on other tests running before them. We also fixed a surprising bug where Bundler 2.0 did not actually change git sources from http to https, despite the docs and warning messages. 😬</p>\\n\\n<p>The most exciting thing we did this month, by far, is <a href=\\\"https://github.com/rubygems/rfcs/blob/master/text/0003-merge-with-rubygems.md#merge-bundler-and-rubygems\\\">moving forward with the Bundler and RubyGems merger</a>! As discussed and agreed on by the Bundler and RubyGems teams, the “maintainer” teams for both repos have been combined into one. Then, we reviewed all the repos in the Bundler GitHub organization, and archived all repos that are not currently being used.</p>\\n\\n<p>Next, the repos <code>gemstash</code>, <code>rfcs</code>, <code>gemx</code>, <code>cacache-rb</code>, <code>bundler-slackin</code>, and <code>ruby-ssl-check</code> were all moved from the Bundler org to the RubyGems org. Assuming nothing explodes, we will shortly move the four remaining repos:  <code>bundler-changelog</code>, <code>bundler-site</code>, <code>bundler.github.io</code>, and of course <code>bundler</code> itself.</p>\\n\\n<p>This month, Bundler gained 66 new commits, contributed by 7 authors. There were 421 additions and 493 deletions across 69 files (nice).</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"rubygemsorg-news\\\">rubygems.org news</h2>\\n\\n<p>RubyGems.org saw general maintenance and dependency updates. The codebase also continued to settle in on Rails 5.2, enabling the new defaults that come with that version of Rails. Webhooks also saw some fixes, both only being sent on successful pushes, and starting to be sent again on yanks.</p>\\n\\n<p>Overall, RubyGems.org gained 39 new commits, contributed by 7 authors. There were 117 additions and 136 deletions across 37 files.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"rubygems-news\\\">rubygems news</h2>\\n\\n<p>RubyGems mostly got fixes this month, including for untarring files with large UID/GID values, as well as a bunch of test improvements and fixes. In total, Rubygems gained 46 new commits, contributed by 10 authors. There were 904 additions and 538 deletions across 29 files.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"gemstash-news\\\">gemstash news</h2>\\n\\n<p>Gemstash got some documentation updates, as well as dependency updates, but the biggest change was moving the repo to <code>rubygems/gemstash</code> as part of the Bundler/RubyGems merge. Hooray!</p>\\n\\n<p>This month, Gemstash gained 13 new commits, contributed by 4 authors. There were 40 additions and 24 deletions across 11 files.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"bridgetroll-news\\\">bridgetroll news</h2>\\n\\n<p>This quarter, Ruby Together is <a href=\\\"https://rubytogether.org/projects\\\">funding a project</a> to maintain and improve <a href=\\\"https://www.bridgetroll.org\\\">BridgeTroll</a>. Here’s the introduction to her project, and we’ll post her updates to the <a href=\\\"https://rubytogether.org/news\\\">Ruby Together blog</a>.</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>Founded in 2008, RailsBridge started offering free workshops aimed at introducing women to Ruby on Rails in a judgment-free environment. Since then, many more “Bridges” have been created with the same mission statement and the Bridge Foundry mother organization was created to manage the financial and organizational objectives for the mostly volunteer organization.</p>\\n\\n  <p>Bridge Troll is part of Bridge Foundry’s core infrastructure, supporting independent community initiatives all over the world with the great potential to increase impact. Bridge Troll is the online engine to ensure that we manage the inflow of students, give a framework to prospective organizers looking to run events, as well as track how many students are benefitting from these workshops. This software helps us apply for further grant funding to ensure that we can continue to run workshops for many years to come. We also want to use this tool as a way to create processes where people can level-up through active open source work with opportunities for a kind and respectful mentorship.</p>\\n\\n  <p>Over the next 3 months, Rachel Ober will be facilitating work to streamline and develop processes to remove roadblocks from Bridge Troll’s backlog and issues database. The main goal during these 3 months is to come up with a process in order to facilitate future collaboration and contributions to the Bridge Troll project and make it clear what our most important goals are.</p>\\n\\n  <p>Rachel will be making monthly updates via the <a href=\\\"https://rubytogether.org/news\\\">Ruby Together newsletter</a> and the <a href=\\\"https://bridgefoundry.org/blog\\\">Bridge Foundry blog</a>.

There were  494 additions and 131 deletions across 47 files.</p>\\n\\n<p>Back in January, we selected David Rodriguez for our first three-month long funded project, to work on Bundler and RubyGems. Here’s his third report from that work:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>Hello everyone!</p>\\n\\n  <p>It’s been two weeks with a lot of activity, not only in terms of code\\nbut also in terms of team discussion. We have established the goal of\\ndiscussing the future of the bundler and rubygems integration with\\nruby-core at Ruby Kaigi. We’ve also had interesting discussions in the\\nteam on how to handle breaking changes going forward, and when and how\\nwe should deliver an upcoming release including deprecations.</p>\\n\\n  <p>On bundler, I continued the work on the deprecations themselves. At this\\npoint, I have a clear view of the set of changes that we plan to\\nrelease, and how we plan to deprecate the old behavior. I’m now closed\\nto the point where I’ll feel comfortable cutting a release from master\\nwith deprecations enabled. I’ve also been compiling the work on each\\ndeprecation into a UPGRADING.md document that explains the reason for\\neach change, and how to migrate to the new behavior. I plan to use this\\ndocument as a draft for a release blog post.</p>\\n\\n  <p>In another line of work, I’ve been polishing the CLI in general to give\\nbetter error messages. In particular, I’m preparing a patch to thor to\\nallow specifying multiple synopsis for a command. The idea here is to\\nease breaking changes like <code>bundle update</code> no longer upgrading all gems.\\nIn order to make this transition easier, I want to make sure <code>bundle\\nupdate</code> gives a proper and helpful error message when being run that\\npoints the user to the different correct alternatives to run the\\ncommand. Given the complicated synopsis of the current <code>bundle update</code>\\ncommand, this patch to thor aims to make this kind of error messages\\nsimpler for the user to understand.</p>\\n\\n  <p>In addition to all that, I continue with the regular work as a bundler\\nmaintainer, making code cleanups, trying to incorporate PRs to master\\nthat had been blocked in the past because of having to support old\\nrubies, and also continuing the work on getting ready for a docker-based\\nCI (which we’ve also discussed internally too).</p>\\n\\n  <p>On rubygems, I continued to cleanup code in master and deprecated a\\nbunch of unused methods. I also continued the discussion on how to get\\n<code>gem install</code> respecting ruby version and rubygems version constraints\\non the gem being installed. Migrating rubygems to use Bundler’s Compact\\nAPI seems like the best solution since other experiments we’ve been\\ndoing on making the filtering on the client side require downloading an\\nexcessive amount of gems, which causes installation to be unbearably\\nslow. Adding support for the compact API in rubygems is the hardest\\nsolution, but the best one, and will also be a big step forward towards\\na future unification of rubygems &amp; bundler.</p>\\n\\n  <p>Will keep you posted in future reports.</p>\\n\\n  <p>Best,</p>\\n\\n  <p>David.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>Two weeks later, here’s his fourth report overall:</p>\\n\\n<p>Hi friends,\\n&gt;\\n&gt; Already eight weeks, phew. Lots of stuff going on, bundler &amp; rubygems\\n&gt; are slowly becoming better software :)\\n&gt;\\n&gt; During the previous two weeks I kept making progress as we move towards\\n&gt; a release including deprecations enabled. The more work I do on\\n&gt; providing a proper deprecation path for our users, the more stuff I find\\n&gt; out that needs to be done. But, I feel I’ve done a lot of progress with\\n&gt; this and I’ve now gone through most things. I wrote an upgrading\\n&gt; document where I talk about each breaking change, the motivations behind\\n&gt; it, and what the migration path will be. I also managed to remove some\\n&gt; unnecessary breaking changes and feature toggles. Besides that, I think\\n&gt; all these efforts have led to the core team have a better and more\\n&gt; consensual vision of the changes that will be made and their\\n&gt; motivations. Many of these changes have been there waiting on master for\\n&gt; a long time, so I think it was useful to have another pass over them,\\n&gt; and evaluate whether they still make sense, and whether the planned\\n&gt; migration still works.\\n&gt;\\n&gt; Something I have also made progress with is to keep improving the\\n&gt; integration of default gems in the ecosystem. Default gems are great but\\n&gt; require rubygems and bundler to be very careful about which gemified\\n&gt; libraries they use, and when. Loading default gems too early results in\\n&gt; a specific versions of them being activated, which might conflict with\\n&gt; the final version end users end up specifying inside their gemfiles. I\\n&gt; have fixed several of these issues, and kept improving the installation\\n&gt; of default gems, making it more consistent with the installation of\\n&gt; standard gems, and more similar to ruby-core’s default gem installer.\\n&gt;\\n&gt; We have also started several important conversations that I hope will\\n&gt; lead to further progress:\\n&gt;\\n&gt; * The bundler &amp; rubygems merge. We started deduplicating some code, and\\n&gt; I improved the current infrastructure that ensures master-to-master\\n&gt; compatibility between both repositories. I also started several\\n&gt; experiments about how the merge should happen. We will have deeper\\n&gt; discussions with the ruby-core team about this soon.\\n&gt;\\n&gt; * The default Rails binstub. I started a discussion in Rails about\\n&gt; whether it should become a standard bundler binstub, thus making\\n&gt; maintenance easier and conflicts less likely.\\n&gt;\\n&gt; And as always, I try to keep fully involved in the regular maintenance\\n&gt; of both repositories, by reviewing PRs, fixing bugs, making the\\n&gt; development environment friendlier to other developers and keeping\\n&gt; master CI’s green against the latest versions of ruby.\\n&gt;\\n&gt; I’ll keep you posted in future reports,\\n&gt;\\n&gt; Best,\\n&gt;\\n&gt; David.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"rubygemsorg-news\\\">rubygems.org news</h2>\\n\\n<p>In March, we migrated from a self-hosted Postgres instance to RDS. After we did that, we noticed a reduction in response time of some of our slowest endpoints by up to half! It was a pleasant surprise. We also updated our webhook functionality to send requests for yank events, which will help third party applications keep their state in sync with rubygems.org. We fixed the issue of password reset not asking the OTP from users who have enabled MFA. We also dropped a dependency on an unmaintained gem (dynamic_form) and incorporated the section of code we were using into our own repository. Lastly, we added Japanese translation to our site, thanks to @m1kit.</p>\\n\\n<p>This month, RubyGems.org gained 34 new commits, contributed by 9 authors.

Send them our way!</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"bundler-news\\\">bundler news</h2>\\n\\n<p>In January, we awarded our <a href=\\\"https://rubytogether.org/projects\\\">first three-month long project grant</a>to David Rodriguez for his work on Bundler and RubyGems. Here’s his first update:</p>\\n\\n<p>Hello everyone!</p>\\n\\n<p>This is my first progress report about my collaboration with Ruby Together to improve Bundler’s release process and deprecation management. I feel really proud that I’ve been given this opportunity, and I will do my best to improve the core of the Ruby ecosystem!</p>\\n\\n<p>I have focused on several things these first two weeks:</p>\\n\\n<p>I stabilized the builds of both Bundler and RubyGems, by fixing skipped tests and flaky failures to get both CIs consistently green. This should make subsequent improvements easier. In RubyGems, I landed several bug fixes in the install and update commands. With the release of Bundler 2 supporting only RubyGems 3.0, the basic command, “gem install rails”, started failing. We reverted the RubyGems 3.0 requirement in Bundler 2.0.1 to workaround this, but I intend to make <code>gem install</code> properly fallback to installing an older version when the <code>required_rubygems_version</code> requirement of the latest version is not satisfied. However, I decided to initially focus on some misc bug fixes in the install and update commands, to familiarize with the RubyGems code base and to be able to tackle this improvement with more confidence in the upcoming weeks. Big kudos to RubyGems contributor @MSP-Greg for providing the initial work for some of these fixes!</p>\\n\\n<p>In Bundler, I started moving forward a new approach for deprecations, which will be enabled by default in the next release. We have a lot of improvements in Bundler’s master, but we haven’t released them for a long time, because they imply breaking changes. By starting to display deprecations for these changes, we’ll be closer to actually being able to release them. I also started addressing some issues surfaced by the Bundler 2 release, specifically about being too picky about the Bundler version a specific application should run. Currently, Bundler will raise if the version in the BUNDLED WITH section of the lock file doesn’t match the running version. We feel it’s premature to do this now, so I’m looking into downgrading this to a warning for the time being. I also coordinated with @colby-swandale the merge of Bundler 2 back into master, which hasn’t yet happened since the Bundler 2 release.</p>\\n\\n<p>Finally, I’ve dedicated a fair amount of time to review the integration of Bundler into ruby-core since the 2.6 release, and the “gemification” of the standard library. Thanks to @hsbt, this is now a reality, but it comes with its own set of difficulties. I’ve been studying these difficulties and creating some fixes and workarounds for them. I plan to keep working on making this transition as smooth as possible for everyone.</p>\\n\\n<p>I really hope my work is appreciated by the community and I expect to deliver better and bigger improvements in the upcoming weeks!</p>\\n\\n<p>Best regards,\\nDavid</p>\\n\\n<p><em>This is a combined update for January and February, so here is David’s second update as well:</em></p>\\n\\n<p>Hello everyone!</p>\\n\\n<p>This is my second report about my collaboration with Rubytogether to improve bundler’s release process and deprecation management. They were a couple of exciting weeks, because I now feel I’m closer to being ready to release some of the work I’ve been doing.</p>\\n\\n<p>The following is a non extensive list of the stuff I’ve been focusing on:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n  <li>I continued the work on bundler’s deprecations. I reviewed each deprecation and made sure the messages are actionable, they show up when they should, and they have passing specs. In particular, I made a plan for the deprecation of the changes that are most likely to be controversial and require special care. For example, I proposed to deprecate sticky options, and custom gemfile sources (such as :github, :gist, or :bitbucket), in a smoother process that should be more friendly to our users because it happens in several steps across multiple major versions. Finally, I made sure that we use non-deprecated features in our own specs, in order to set a good example :)</li>\\n  <li>In addition to deprecations, I also finished the work that I mentioned in <a href=\\\"\\\">the previous report</a> about only reporting warnings and not hard errors when we find a mismatch between the running bundler version and the version the Gemfile was created with. I hope to release these changes in both rubygems and bundler soon.</li>\\n  <li>I also continued to improve the integration of bundler into ruby-core. I proposed to <a href=\\\"https://github.com/bundler/bundler/pull/6985\\\">eliminate the <code>git</code> dependency from bundler’s gemspec</a> (which has caused problems with the integration), and raised <a href=\\\"https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15610\\\">an issue</a> with ruby-core about where the default copies of bundler &amp; rubygems should live, and how they should get updated. I’m in touch with hsbt and we plan to discuss the future of this integration some time in the near future.</li>\\n  <li>Finally, I’ve been working on making our specs “docker friendly”, and making bundler testable under bare docker images of ruby and rvm. My understanding is that this should make it much easier to reproduce CI failures (or user reported bugs), and to detect version manager specific regressions (or ruby-core integration bugs). Besides that, testing on top of custom docker images is something provided built-in by Azure pipelines, so it’s a good opportunity to try it.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>As I mentioned in the previous report, I’m very glad to be working on bundler during these weeks. Any suggestions or feedback you may have, feel free to share them through Github, Slack or whatever means you like!</p>\\n\\n<p>See you again soon,</p>\\n\\n<p>David.</p>\\n\\n<p>In January and February, Bundler gained 110 new commits, contributed by 11 authors. There were 1,401 additions and 1,503 deletions across 849 files.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"rubygemsorg-news\\\">rubygems.org news</h2>\\n\\n<p>In last two months, we updated the search API to use Elasticsearch, which resolves multiple issues including <a href=\\\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/issues/972\\\">missing search results</a> and <a href=\\\"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/issues/1256\\\">slow performance</a>. Thanks to @lucianosousa, we are now using Rails 5.2.2. We would also like to let you know that we sprinkled some styling to our email templates and now they are no longer being marked as spam by some email providers. We haven’t received any new help ticket for email being lost in last month—a good sign!</p>\\n\\n<p>In mid February, we had to impose rate limit of one yank request per 10 min because we were seeing some users yank hundreds of gems at once. Our yank API endpoint was extremely slow, and hundreds of yanks at once was causing site instability. Since then we have worked hard on some optimizations and we are happy to report that we have brought down the average response time of Yank API from 4000 ms to 250 ms.</p>\\n\\n<p>In January and February, Rubygems.org gained 67 new commits, contributed by 8 authors.

Not only is he a core team member of Bundler, he is the author of Byebug and Pry-byebug, as well as on the ActiveAdmin core team.</p>\\n\\n<p>Here’s his message about the project:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>During the next months, I’ll be focusing on fixing some problems and surprises surfaced after the bundler 2.0 release, and bundler’s integration into ruby-core. I’ll also try to make sure we’re protected against the same kind of things happening in future releases. I’d like the bundler team to be able to ship bug fix and feature releases more confidently, with less regressions, and without any surprises whatsoever for users.</p>\\n\\n  <p>For example,</p>\\n\\n  <ul>\\n    <li>\\n      <p>Users should be able to early opt in to certain new features, thus providing early feedback and bug reports without affecting the majority of the users not yet trying those features.</p>\\n    </li>\\n    <li>\\n      <p>The default availability of certain features should be toggleable in a smooth manner, by providing UI messages announcing the change, and a migration path for users who want to either migrate early, or stay in the old behavior.</p>\\n    </li>\\n    <li>\\n      <p>Features should be deprecatable, and finally removable through a smooth process that properly informs users about how to replace them with better alternatives.</p>\\n    </li>\\n    <li>\\n      <p>Really basic stuff, such as <code>gem install rails</code>, should be tested at the highest most realistic level, so that regressions never happen.</p>\\n    </li>\\n  </ul>\\n\\n  <p>All of these ideas are currently half baked in bundler’s master, but still require some work and some actual releases to wrap them up and put them into action. My project is about making this happen.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>In December, Bundler reached two huge and exciting milestones. First, Ruby included Bundler for the first time ever, including Bundler 1.17.2 in Ruby 2.6. Special thanks are due to <a href=\\\"https://github.com/hsbt\\\">@hsbt</a> for years worth of work integrating Bundler into the ruby-core test suite and keeping everything working and up to date.</p>\\n\\n<p>Second, Bundler <a href=\\\"https://bundler.io/blog/2019/01/03/announcing-bundler-2.html\\\">shipped version 2.0</a>! It’s a big milestone, and the Bundler team is very excited to adopt a yearly major release cadence, to better match Ruby itself.</p>\\n\\n<p>Bundler gained 55 new commits, contributed by 7 authors. There were 225 additions and 63 deletions across 21 files.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"rubygemsorg-news\\\">rubygems.org news</h2>\\n\\n<p>In RubyGems.org news, lead RubyGems.org maintainer <a href=\\\"https://github.com/dwradcliffe\\\">@dwradcliffe</a> completed porting the production RubyGems.org deployment to use Kubernetes! This didn’t cause any user-facing changes, but makes it easier for others to develop locally, and will help us with our efforts to avoid downtime.</p>\\n\\n<p>Another major development was enabling two factor authentication, a Google Summer of Code project that can greatly improve the security of logging in and publishing new gems, for any gem authors who enable it.</p>\\n\\n<p>In addition to those major developments, we continued to fix bugs, improve translations, and generally keep things humming along.</p>\\n\\n<p>This month, RubyGems.org gained 57 new commits, contributed by 11 authors. There were 1,362 additions and 1,259 deletions across 111 files.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"rubygems-news\\\">rubygems news</h2>\\n\\n<p>December for RubyGems was also a big milestone: we shipped RubyGems 3.0.0! The biggest changes were S3 sources, multi-threaded gem downloads, support for two-factor authentication, and including Bundler 1.17.2.</p>\\n\\n<p>In addition to those big changes, we continued to clean up unused code, improve warning and error messages, and fix bugs.</p>\\n\\n<p>This month, RubyGems gained 149 new commits, contributed by 15 authors. There were 1,699 additions and 1,509 deletions across 270 files.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"ruby-toolbox-news\\\">ruby toolbox news</h2>\\n\\n<p>Hey everyone,</p>\\n\\n<p>As mentioned in recent updates, I set aside some time and have been working on the Ruby Toolbox as my main project in December and January thanks to Ruby Together’s backing.</p>\\n\\n<p>There’s been a flurry of activity in that time.

As mentioned in the blog post, Bundler 2 will drop support for Ruby versions that are no longer supported by the Ruby core team.</p>\\n\\n<p>If you’re feeling adventurous, you can even try the Bundler 2 prerelease by running <code>gem install bundler --pre</code>. (You can even use the Bundler 2 prerelease on Heroku, with the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/bundler/heroku-buildpack-bundler2\\\">Bundler 2 buildpack</a>!).</p>\\n\\n<p>For the less adventurous, we’re writing documentation furiously, and we will post a full Bundler 2 upgrade guide along with the final 2.0.0 release.</p>\\n\\n<p>This month, Bundler gained 44 new commits, contributed by 10 authors. There were 331 additions and 150 deletions across 51 files.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"rubygemsorg-news\\\">rubygems.org news</h2>\\n\\n<p>In November, we updated 19 dependencies on RubyGems.org including security updates to rack and activejob. Thanks to a report that came in from HackerOne, we fixed a bug that would allow an attacker to guess an <code>api_key</code> by sending all of their guesses as an array along with the request. We also fixed some other issues reported through HackerOne, including rate limits on forgotten password requests, and profile pages being viewable after logout using the browser back button. We also removed the only use of IFrames (GitHub stars), and updated our CSP. Finally, we now have better Dutch translations thanks to <a href=\\\"https://github.com/sharkwouter\\\">@sharkwouter</a>, a first time contributor to RubyGems.org.</p>\\n\\n<p>This month, RubyGems.org gained 37 commits from 6 authors, making changes to 60 files with 1,796 insertions and 1,038 deletions.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"rubygems-news\\\">rubygems news</h2>\\n\\n<p>RubyGems saw a lot of cleanup and bugfixes this month. We also merged <a href=\\\"https://github.com/ecnelises\\\">@ecnelises</a>’s Google Summer of Code Project, which adds support for two-factor authentication to RubyGems.org. 2FA is a huge boost to account security, and once we have everything released and working, we’ll encourage everyone to turn it on. In total, RubyGems gained 125 new commits, contributed by 12 authors. There were 1,532 additions and 1,500 deletions across 268 files.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"gemstash-news\\\">gemstash news</h2>\\n\\n<p>In November, Gemstash version 2.0.0 shipped!

Designed and planned by board member Coraline Ada Ehmke, Ruby Me pairs early-career developers with seasoned Rubyists to work on open source projects for three months. Both mentees and mentors are compensated for 8 hours of work per month. The goal of Ruby Me is to help bring people from underrepresented backgrounds into open source and support them in their professional growth.</p>\\n\\n<p>We saw an overwhelmingly positive response come from the wider community. In one week, we received over 900 applications from prospective apprentices and over 125 applications from prospective mentors.

In that time, we’ve grown from funding just 2 devs working 10 hours per week, to funding up to 50 hours per week when it’s needed to keep Ruby’s gem infrastructure running smoothly.</p>\\n\\n<p>As you can probably imagine, it takes a lot more to organize ten developers than it took to organize two. Because of that, we’re making some changes to how Ruby Together is structured to make sure all of that work continues to get done.</p>\\n\\n<p>Starting this month, we’re retiring our existing position of CEO, and replacing it with an Executive Director position. While it includes many of the previous responsibilities of the CEO, the ED position comes with a new job description, new criteria for success, and direct oversight by the board of directors.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Executive Director will not be a member of the Board of Directors, and will not determine budgets or spending. Instead, they will be responsible for running Ruby Together on a day to day basis, implementing the strategy and plans decided on by the board.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Executive Director will be paid for administrative and corporate work. They will not be paid for any open source work. This will allow them to focus their efforts on fundraising and collaboration with the Ruby community. Our first Executive Director will be André Arko.</p>\\n\\n<p>Along with the new ED position, we’re resetting the size of the board of directors to 5 people. No one is being added or removed from the board to make that happen, but that size will keep our core working group in the 5-7 person range. Keeping the core working group small and focused is especially important for our scheduling, discussion, and decision-making, and the board was in unanimous agreement that the new size will improve our work.</p>\\n\\n<p>We’re excited to enter a new phase as a “grown up” non-profit, and we’re looking forward to being able to support the Ruby open source community for years to come. 💎💝</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"bundler-news\\\">bundler news</h2>\\n\\n<p>With the help of <a href=\\\"http://github.com/eanlain\\\">@eanlain</a>, we shipped a new guide: <a href=\\\"https://bundler.io/v1.16/guides/bundler_docker_guide.html\\\">“How to use Bundler with Docker”</a>. We also dramatically improved error messages when version requirements conflict, shipped a playbook for adding or removing core team members, and fixed some issues handling gemspecs with non-ASCII characters. We also merged a fix that could cause Bundler to <a href=\\\"https://github.com/bundler/bundler/pull/6675\\\">fail when trying to install a gem that has had a version yanked recently</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>On top of that code work, we also added two new contributors to <a href=\\\"https://bundler.io/contributors.html\\\">the Bundler team</a>! Welcome to <a href=\\\"https://www.twitter.com/radiomorillo\\\">Stephanie Morillo</a> and <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/greybaker\\\">Grey Baker</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>Stephanie has helped create new Bundler docs (like the troubleshooting RubyGems and Bundler TLS/SSL issues guide), and update existing ones. She’s also responsible for updating the Bundler contributor guidelines and trying to make Bundler docs more accessible to new contributors. We’re excited to have her on board, and looking forward to working with her more in the future.</p>\\n\\n<p>Grey is the author of <a href=\\\"https://dependabot.com\\\">Dependabot</a>, and has regularly contributed to <a href=\\\"https://github.com/cocoapods/molinillo\\\">Molinillo</a>, the core resolver library that powers Bundler, RubyGems, and Cocoapods.</p>\\n\\n<p>In total this month, Bundler gained 58 new commits, contributed by 10 authors.

For the user this means a better understanding of, for example, which arguments are optional and which are required, and which keys are needed in hash arguments.</p>\\n\\n<p>“By being able to infer the type signatures you can infer directly from the code. So you can ensure that the accuracy is a lot better.”</p>\\n\\n<p>With such a vast improvement to the documentation searchability on the horizon, it’s hard to believe that just a two years ago Ruby API almost ceased to exist.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"the-ruby-api-story\\\">The Ruby API Story</h3>\\n\\n<p>Colby was inspired to create the Ruby API app in 2018. He says it “was a passion project of mine but it was born out of frustration.”</p>\\n\\n<p>At the time there was no one reliable place Ruby developers could easily search for items in the documentation they were looking for. A combination of the large number of sites using generated docs and Google’s difficulty understanding Ruby documentation, led to confusing and inconsistent search results. Often a search of the documentation would return several outdated or irrelevant versions of Ruby.</p>\\n\\n<p>On the sites that were available (https://www.ruby-lang.org, Rubydoc.org  and API doc) the UI on mobile and tablets left a lot to be desired. Over two years, and four iterations Colby set out to create a solution — having varying success with either the search feature or the UI but struggling to have both operate well at once.</p>\\n\\n<p>Then, he had a eureka moment in a conversation with a friend who happened to be taking a course on Elastic Search. He did some research into the search engine to find out more. It turned out Elastic Search had the exact features he was looking for to improve the search, and provide the results he was looking for.</p>\\n\\n<p>“You could do things like give priorities to arbitrary values, so if you search for a method that’s in, like, a string, the core Ruby class would get the highest search results.”</p>\\n\\n<p>With a search feature that finally seemed ready, and a new found rush of motivation Colby got momentum to design a UI that was fully responsive on desktop, mobile and tablets. In early 2019 he shipped the first version of the app on Heroku. As a soft launch, he shared the link out with a few members of the Ruby community to test and received positive feedback. Then he posted the link publicly on twitter.</p>\\n\\n<p>The result was basically, crickets. There wasn’t much site traffic. “I think it was like, maybe less than five people a day were using it,” he says.</p>\\n\\n<p>Admittedly, Colby says he didn’t make a huge promotional push. He didn’t post about the app on Reddit, Hacker News or any other large platform where developer content often goes viral. Instead it was spread by word of mouth.</p>\\n\\n<p>After a few months of low usage, Colby’s motivation to maintain the project was dwindling. He decided to shut the Ruby API site down, leaving the project open only on GitHub for users to run on their own. He made an announcement about it on twitter. It was then he realized just how useful the site was to Ruby users.</p>\\n\\n<p>An outpouring of support came in from people who had been using the app. Users reached out to ask him not to take it down.</p>\\n\\n<p>Friends in the Ruby community shared their enthusiasm for Ruby API on twitter, Hacker News, and the Ruby subreddit. It was even added to the list of resources on the official Ruby documentation website.</p>\\n\\n<p>“People were very vocal, and that was a huge motivation,” says Colby.</p>\\n\\n<p>Ruby API received a huge surge of traffic that day. Importantly it confirmed Colby’s initial hunch that the Ruby community needed a new and improved approach to documentation.</p>\\n\\n<p>“They gave me validation that I was actually on the right path — that there actually is a problem, people know there is a problem and we’re all seeking for something better.”</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"the-future-of-ruby-api-and-how-you-can-help\\\">The Future of Ruby API (And How You Can Help!)</h3>\\n\\n<p>Aside from type signatures, there are a few other features Colby would like to add to the app down the line.</p>\\n\\n<p>“I eventually want to bring all gem documentation into Ruby API,” he says.</p>\\n\\n<p>The most important part of the Ruby API story to him is how crucial it is to hear from users.</p>\\n\\n<p>From the chance conversation with a developer friend that spurred the app, to the community of beta testers, to the Ruby users whose feedback have resulted in some of the features the app has now (like being able to run code examples) — the app is what it is because of community support.</p>\\n\\n<p>“This is a project that anyone can help make better.

However, like many, her journey in the open source space did not start there.</p>\\n\\n<p>“I’ve been programming computers since I was a kid,” says Ehmke. “In the early days, you know, source code was in magazines. You’d get your Byte magazine and you’d turn to the back and there was a source code listing and you would type it in, and that’s how you got the program.”</p>\\n\\n<p>To the creator of the widely-adopted <a href=\\\"https://www.contributor-covenant.org/\\\">contributor covenant</a>, and founder of the Organization for Ethical Source, open source was simply a formalization of the long tradition of sharing software for free. It was a way to make programming accessible and safer for users. Over time, though, she began to realize “open, as an ethical principle, was not sufficient.”</p>\\n\\n<p>In 2018 large tech companies, including Palantir and Amazon, came <a href=\\\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/09/29/technology-202-activists-slam-palantir-its-work-with-ice-ahead-market-debut/\\\">under fire</a> for providing data and surveillance infrastructure to governmental organizations in the US, including local police departments and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). That year the Latinx and Chicanx activist group Mijente launched the #NoTechForICE campaign, including protests and organizing against the use of technology to facilitate human rights violations, including the <a href=\\\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dhs-inspector-general-report-reveals-squalid-conditions-at-migrant-detention-centers/\\\">violent treatment</a> of undocumented immigrant families, and <a href=\\\"https://www.dailydot.com/debug/amazon-hq-rekognition-ice-protest/\\\">systemic racial profiling</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>The powerful leverage companies like this have in the open source landscape was brought into sharp focus for many developers when Seth Vargo, a well known open source contributor and former employee of the Chef app, tried to participate in the protest. When he found out the company had a contract with ICE he removed his code from the platform in an act of solidarity, only to find within hours it had been restored. Even though he was the creator of the code and did not condone its use, he was left with no recourse.</p>\\n\\n<p>The incident inspired Ehmke to create <a href=\\\"https://firstdonoharm.dev/\\\">the Hippocratic License</a>, an Ethical Source license prohibiting the use of software that is in violation of human rights. These efforts grew into the Ethical Source movement and what is now <a href=\\\"https://ethicalsource.dev/\\\">the Organization for Ethical Source</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://draftin.com:443/images/79282?token=tWqoDbEjuzxu1in9vlec-0sYyro2yxjCZXaro7jRpq6Hp_JVi-n-pTte0tWJirr0bOhQ_h4sRLyIedXbJT-k4Nw\\\" alt=\\\"Screen Shot 2021-08-06 at 12.50.01 PM.png\\\" /></p>\\n\\n<p>A common misconception about Ethical Source is that it is solely about licensing, due to its origins in the Hippocratic License. Ehmke notes that this is not true. Instead, the Ethical Source movement seeks to create a culture around seven organizing principles, including “our work is done in the open,” “our community strives to be welcoming and just” and “our work deserves support.”</p>\\n\\n<p>Many of these values are shared with the founding principles at Ruby Together, where Ehmke became an early member of the board. “The Ruby community led the way in normalizing codes of conduct for open source projects and open source communities,” she says, “So I would love to see the Ruby community continue to demonstrate that leadership.” The Contributor Covenant, which Ehmke wrote in 2014 as a standard for Ruby Together supported projects, became one of the most popular codes of conduct in the open source community. It has been adopted by over a hundred thousand open source communities and projects including Google, Microsoft, Linux and Salesforce.</p>\\n\\n<p>Endorsement by tech industry giants did not prevent the code of conduct from loud criticism from those who do not align with its ideals. Both the Contributor Covenant and the Ethical Source movement received similar backlash, albeit from different facets of the open source community. When it came to the code of conduct, the major pushback was from individual developers. The Ethical Source movement has received backlash at the institutional level as well, with organizations like the Open Source Initiative declaring that the movement does not align with the practice of open source. Even supporters of the effort <a href=\\\"https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2021/04/open-source-software-freedom-from-ethics/\\\">appear hesitant</a> to adopt the principles, for fear of legal repercussions and enforcement.</p>\\n\\n<p>Ehmke acknowledges that widespread adoption of Ethical Source will not happen as easily or in the same way as the adoption of open source itself, due to the fact that they were created with different goals in mind. According to Ehmke, open source served to make source available software palatable to corporations. On the other hand, Ethical Source tries to level the playing field between the creator community and the companies that adopt their work. “It has to be a symbiotic relationship in order to be fair,” says Ehmke. As such, she believes these practices will become more widely disseminated as individual developers and communities adopt them, incentivizing corporations to do so as well.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Organization for Ethical Source has been developing tools and resources that will be immediately applicable in open source communities, so that Ethical Source principals can be put into practice, tested and more easily understood. “We are drawing on the collective wisdom and expertise of people from different parts of the world with different specializations,” Ehmke asserts. These include a former Mozilla fellow whose project focused on how indigenous wisdom can inform open source communities, an anthropologist who has conducted ethnographic studies on software development communities, and a member of the Center for Democracy and Technology who works on governance in digital communities.</p>\\n\\n<p>Ultimately, Ehmke says the Ethical Source movement is about “incorporating broadly shared values into the work we do, with the aim of producing better outcomes for the world at large.” Whether or not they succeed, she hopes to set an example for other organizations to follow. “And I hope someone else does,” she says, “because we just cannot go on pretending that tech is neutral.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}"},{"title":"Ruby In Google Summer of Code 2021","status":"published","published_at":1631035140,"mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"html\",{\"cardName\":\"html\",\"html\":\"\\n<h2 id=\\\"ruby-in-google-summer-of-code-2021\\\">Ruby in Google Summer of Code 2021</h2>\\n\\n<p>We were delighted to act as fiscal sponsor for the Ruby organization as part of Google’s Summer of Code (GSOC) program. This year, the org was administrated by Ruby core team member Koichi Sasada. Read on to hear from two students who participated in this year.</p>\\n\\n<p>王新宇 Wang Xinyu, a third year university student in software engineering at Tongji University, Shanghai, contributed to an event-based profiling tool inspired by Google Chromium. The profiler is designed to help analyze Ruby’s boot process and locate the bottleneck. The aim is to deliver faster gem loading for Ruby users, and provide a way to analyze Ruby VM performance intuitively for MRI developers.</p>\\n\\n<p>The profiling tool won’t be delivered to Ruby app developers, but with a little bit of hacking, they should be able to use it to analyze their own C extensions.</p>\\n\\n<p>Delton Ding is another GSOC student in the Ruby project this year. His work this summer focused on the fiber scheduler feature released with Ruby 3.0 last Christmas. “People like like Ruby on Rails because its syntax… is very easy to use, but the performance of that is very bad,” Ding shared. The fiber scheduler allows programmers to keep the syntax of [their] original Ruby code, but get performance that is “100 or 1000 times faster,” says Ding.</p>\\n\\n<p>The project is still in its early phases, and Ding spent his summer experimenting with this part of the code.</p>\\n\\n<p>GSOC allowed both Xinyu and Ding to become more integrated into the Ruby community, and learn how to most effectively move their projects forward.</p>\\n\\n<p>One of the most exciting parts of the experience for Xinyu was the chance to connect with his mentor, Koichi Sasada. Sasada created the current Ruby VM (YARV). “I’ve learnt a lot Ruby internals and other programming knowledge from him,” says Xinyu. He also learned a bit of Japanese. “This is my first time to really touch Ruby… it’s mostly written by the Japanese team… and the documentation is English [laughs]… Sometimes I have to read Japanese… but, I’m Chinese.”</p>\\n\\n<p>Luckily his mentor is a Japanese programmer and was able to help with the translation. “It’s a little bit challenging to let others know the exact idea we want to express, but so far it’s okay.”</p>\\n\\n<p>A major part of Ding’s experience was also learning the communication process within the larger Ruby community. In particular he learned the importance of running his ideas by the maintainers of the code that he wants to change, before submitting a change request to Ruby itself.</p>\\n\\n<p>“Once you submit the whole proposal then people are trying to review it instead of discussing it. In that case then, yeah, there may be a lot of, like, vulnerabilities or something for your project,” Ding explained.</p>\\n\\n<p>More on Xinyu, Ding and all of the 2021 GSOC students’ final projects can be found <a href=\\\"https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4524421995298816\\\">here</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>GSOC just wrapped its 16th year of student software development mentorships. The program was designed by Google co-founder Larry Page in 2005 to help students retain programming skills during their school breaks, and learn a broader range of practical software development knowledge most easily gained through participating in open source projects.

Whether you’re entering the fall, as we are here in the US, or welcoming in another season, this turning point can be a good time to reflect on how far we’ve come this year, and how we’d like the remaining part of it to go. It’s a good time to review the goals we set out to meet and check whether they are on track, and if we want to make any adjustments going forward. It’s also a wonderful time to remember the importance of the work we do together and recommit to what we’ve been building.</p>\\n\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://draftin.com:443/images/79600?token=XizZEln-lOEwm3vEufeYRIARVOs9YqOnTn19IazFR8t-jO5qIS-7g6SLZfuQRFaaJcWf2XgDKzx_ySTuZBczwt0\\\" alt=\\\"Fall_Leaves.png\\\" /></p>\\n\\n<p>Since we started almost seven years ago, Ruby Together’s vision has been to serve as a reliable, reinforcing framework in the Ruby ecosystem, not only for the stability of the infrastructure, and vitality of the projects, but also for the wellness of the community. We set out to bring that vision to life with a two-fold mission:</p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n  <li>Cultivating healthy open source projects</li>\\n  <li>Working for and with the Ruby community</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"cultivating-healthy-open-source-projects\\\">Cultivating healthy open source projects</h2>\\n\\n<p>The first challenge when cultivating healthy open source projects is agreeing about what “healthy” means. At Ruby Together we’ve focused on a few measures of project health where we can have the greatest impact. The first is increasing the number of open-source maintainers, to reduce burnout and the other risks that come with having a solo maintainer on a project. We’ve done this by choosing to bring in more developers with fewer hours per week, rather than aiming for only full-time developers.</p>\\n\\n<p>The second is welcoming and encouraging new contributors with all levels of experience. We do this by making projects easy for anyone to contribute to, and establishing a collaborative, positive space for projects, with a clear enforcement policy. We also periodically do outreach, inviting developers who are just starting to become more frequent contributors.</p>\\n\\n<p>One of our members Stephan Kämper shared, “I find a healthy, helpful and friendly community to be really important. Life, especially in these corona times, is hard enough. As a friend (and contributor to an ebook project I’m running) puts it in his contribution title: ‘We all are being hit the hardest’.”</p>\\n\\n<p>Finally, when choosing new projects we strive for transparency with a publicly shared project proposal, evaluation and <a href=\\\"https://rubytogether.org/projects\\\">funding process</a>.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"working-for-and-with-the-ruby-community\\\">Working for and with the Ruby community</h2>\\n\\n<p>You’ve heard it before on the Ruby official site: “The community that grows up around a programming language is one of its most important strengths.” We agree!</p>\\n\\n<p>We are grateful to be supported by so many members of the large and longstanding Ruby developer community. We trust our members and invite them to hold us accountable in a number of ways. Our board is elected by our members, and maintains <a href=\\\"https://github.com/rubytogether/feedback\\\">a public feedback forum</a>. We also set limits on the amount of funding that companies can give. These limits prevent any one company from having too large an influence over the the projects we fund and the work we do.</p>\\n\\n<p>“I value the idea that healthy open source languages, frameworks, and other foundational tooling isn’t ‘owned’ by any one company,” shares member Jared White. “A plethora of companies and individuals (and even governments!) is necessary to fund, maintain, and sustain open source software for the good of humanity.” </p>\\n\\n<p>Speaking of the work we do, we report to you exactly what we’ve done with the money you contribute in an <a href=\\\"https://rubytogether.org/news\\\">update</a> we publish every month, and <a href=\\\"https://www.getdrip.com/forms/6239290/submissions/new\\\">you can subscribe here</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>Finally, we collaborate with other Ruby community organizations: in the past we have worked with Ruby Central, RailsGirls, Google Summer of Code, and others to support the work they are doing for the Ruby community.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"moving-our-mission-forward\\\">Moving our mission forward</h2>\\n\\n<p>A lot more is possible! The more we cultivate our community the more we can bring your dream projects to fruition.</p>\\n\\n<p>Member Jared White envisions “A ‘Ruby component’ specification of some kind for web frameworks. For example: GitHub’s ViewComponent is very cool, but it’s Rails-only. If there were a lower-level spec that VC could build on top of, in theory it would work in Rails or Bridgetown equally.”</p>\\n\\n<p>We welcome your new ideas, too.</p>\\n\\n<p>We’re grateful for your support over the years and we’d love to be able to grow and keep supporting the projects that Ruby developers like you use every day. If you or your company would like to help us do so, you can sign up <a href=\\\"https://rubytogether.org/developers\\\">as a developer</a> or <a href=\\\"https://rubytogether.org/companies\\\">as a company</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>What are you reflecting on or revisiting this season?

It’s a fusion that felt like a long time coming, and one that will make things easier for members of both of our organizations, and for our teams too.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>So, what happened to Ruby Together?</strong></p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"what-even-was-ruby-together\\\">What even <em>was</em> Ruby Together?</h2>\\n\\n<p>Ruby Together started as a trade organization that paid developers to work on RubyGems, Bundler, and more, using funds from members. Members could be any person or company who uses Ruby, and the work they paid for was free for anyone to use. Over the past six years Ruby Together grew to take on more ambitious projects and give back continuously to the Ruby ecosystem. Here’s a little bit of our story…</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"ruby-together-was-born-out-of-necessity\\\">Ruby Together was born out of necessity.</h2>\\n\\n<p>Back in the Ruby dark ages, everyone who worked on RubyGems.org was an unpaid volunteer. We were able to maintain this until… we weren’t. In 2013 RubyGems.org <a href=\\\"https://blog.rubygems.org/2013/01/31/data-verification.html\\\">went down completely</a> — and stayed down for multiple days — all because no one had the time to fix a potential security issue fast enough. When the security issue was discovered everyone on the team was balancing work obligations. We decided that whichever one of us was done with work first would be the one to apply the security patches. As it turned out, no one was able to fix the problem before the weekend. Unfortunately, someone independently discovered the security issue and used it to hack the RubyGems.org server. </p>\\n\\n<p><strong>The week that followed was a very bad week.</strong> Multiple people who worked on RubyGems.org took unexpected time off from their paid jobs. We had to create completely new servers from scratch. We also had to download and verify every single one of the hundreds of thousands of .gem files, to make sure the hacker hadn’t replaced any of them while they had access. It felt like all the work we had done up until that point was a huge waste – and also showed us what a massive risk not having paid developers maintaining our systems could be.</p>\\n\\n<p>After the incident, André, who was working on Bundler at the time, began to focus his efforts on finding funding to pay developers working on Bundler and RubyGems. In late 2014 he received an enthusiastic response from Stripe, who was the first to provide financial backing for the cause. Engine Yard followed soon after, and in February 2015 we launched Ruby Together as a trade organization.</p>\\n\\n<p>In the years that have followed, we’ve funded the ongoing maintenance of Bundler and RubyGems, and managed to prevent any incidents of server downtime from occurring. On top of that, our members’ support has allowed us to expand our funded projects beyond infrastructure maintenance, making it possible to fund projects like <a href=\\\"https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/\\\">Ruby Toolbox</a>, <a href=\\\"https://rubytogether.org/news/2021-07-01-a-new-approach-to-documentation-ruby-api\\\">Ruby API</a>, and <a href=\\\"https://rubygems.org/gems/simplecov/versions/0.21.2\\\">SimpleCov</a>, and programs like <a href=\\\"https://rubyme.org/\\\">RubyMe</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>We’ve also reached some huge milestones:</strong></p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n  <li>there are now over 175,000 gems (up from 101,000)</li>\\n  <li>there are over 1,216,000 versions of gems (up from 583,000)</li>\\n  <li>we have served 64 billion (!) gem downloads (up from 4.5 billion in 2015)</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>and made several other <a href=\\\"https://rubytogether.org/news/2020-12-15-five-things-to-be-grateful-for-in-the-ruby-together-community\\\">accomplishments</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>We’ve done all this while upholding <a href=\\\"https://www.contributor-covenant.org/\\\">values</a> that support the wellness of the Ruby community.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"but-there-was-an-ongoing-dilemma\\\">But there was an ongoing dilemma…</h2>\\n\\n<p>While we were carrying out our mission in more ways than we could have imagined when we started, \\nRuby users were confusing the mission and purpose of Ruby Together with that of Ruby Central. It was already an uphill battle to obtain support from companies for Ruby Together’s infrastructure-related open source work, as it’s work that is mostly invisible and has historically been done for free. The confusion between our two organizations only added to that challenge.</p>\\n\\n<p>To try to address this, Ruby Together board member Jonan Scheffler put forward a vision of a single Ruby non-profit, and worked hard to get everyone on both boards engaged with that idea. Although at first there was some hesitation, it began to feel more and more like the right choice as the pandemic spurred Ruby Together towards new methods of community outreach and motivated Ruby Central to develop a membership program. Ultimately, both boards were able to hash out the details in a way everyone felt was a great fit.</p>\\n\\n<p>We’re very happy to continue carrying out our original mission as a new organization that is still aligned with Ruby Together’s values.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"so-whats-next\\\">So, what’s next?</h2>\\n\\n<p>For Ruby Together members, your membership will continue to support the same work. We’ll continue to support paid development work on Bundler and RubyGems, and we will continue to fund other Ruby projects whenever we have funding to do so. You’ll still be able to connect with us in the ways that you were, and your Ruby Together membership will be transferred to the Ruby Central membership system automatically.</p>\\n\\n<p>In addition, Ruby Central is launching a new membership program that will eventually include newsletters, virtual events, a dedicated Slack workspace, early registration and discounted tickets to our conferences. For corporate members, we plan to provide support with building brand awareness, and access to resources, people, and events.</p>\\n\\n<p>Our goal is to grow our membership program and be the main hub for all Ruby programmers and institutions.</p>\\n\\n<p>We know that combining the <a href=\\\"https://rubytogether.org/news/2021-10-18-staying-the-course\\\">mission</a> of Ruby Together to financially support developers, with the immense value Ruby Central conferences provide our community, will only make us stronger.

If you do select a track, there’s no obligation to stay on it. You’re free to move between tracks, move in and out of a track, or start on a track and then move on to general talks if you’d like.</p>\\n\\n<p>Or, “there’s always the hallway track,” as RailsConf 2022 program committee member Aisha Blake puts it.</p>\\n\\n<p>But if you do decide to stick to a track through the entirety of the conference, you’re in for a treat. The talks in each track aren’t simply grouped together by category, their sequence is considered and intentional.</p>\\n\\n<p>“The talks are ordered,” RailsConf 2022 program co-chair Max Tiu explains, “and narratives are crafted.” As a result, “you get more of a cohesive experience around an area of interest.”</p>\\n\\n<p>You may still be wondering: “Should I choose a conference track? And if so, which one?” Well, you’re in luck! I connected with the program committee curating this year’s tracks to ask why they chose each talk, and what to look forward to from each track. Read on to get a closer view of the RailsConf 2022 tracks…</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"make-a-switch\\\">Make a switch</h3>\\n\\n<p>“What if you made a radical shift?” poses Brittany Martin, an Engineering Manager and cohost of the Ruby on Rails Podcast. She curated the “Make a Switch” track, which is officially described as:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>The track for the ambitious speakers who made a switch and the lessons they learned along the way. Left React for Hotwire? Refocused from logging to telemetry? In-sourced what you out-sourced? Bring your radical tooling, workflow and approach changes to this track.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>“As a podcaster, I love storytelling so I was excited to craft a track where developers like us could share the ambitious risks they took and the technical takeaways.”</p>\\n\\n<p>Martin anticipates that this track may lead to an “aha” moment for those who choose it, and she encourages teams to attend talks together, especially if they are relevant to your stack.</p>\\n\\n<p>This track is ideal for developers at all levels who have influence over technical and process decisions on their team.</p>\\n\\n<p>Martin encourages potential attendees with the reminder that “even if the subject in not in your wheelhouse (i.e. Frontend or DevOps tooling), you are not only attending for yourself but for your colleagues and friends.”</p>\\n\\n<p>Interest piqued? Here are <a href=\\\"https://railsconf.org/program/sessions#track-make-a-switch\\\">the talks in the Make a Switch track</a>.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"explain-it-like-im-five\\\">Explain It Like I’m Five</h3>\\n\\n<p>If you’re seeking a crash course on some of the most fundamental concepts in Rails, “Explain It Like I’m Five” (or ELIF) is your perfect lane.</p>\\n\\n<p>Software engineer Emily Giurleo organized this track. Like the popular subreddit, she hopes it will serve as a welcoming space for conference goers to get a breakdown of core concepts, tools and skills that may seem complicated on the surface.</p>\\n\\n<p>“Too often, people think that certain concepts are too advanced for them to understand. I wanted to show that there is no such thing as ‘too advanced’ – with the right framing, any of us can understand concepts usually reserved for experts,” Giurleo explains.</p>\\n\\n<p>She believes this track will appeal to developers at different levels for different reasons. For beginner and mid-level developers these talks will offer a chance to move toward mastery of the Ruby on Rails framework. Meanwhile, experienced developers will be able to sharpen their skills when it comes to communicating advanced topics in an approachable way.</p>\\n\\n<p>If you’re looking to go in depth on specific topics, this track is not for you. Giurleo explains, “While the talks on this track do cover advanced topics, they are meant to serve as an entry point.”</p>\\n\\n<p>Get started on a new concept with <a href=\\\"https://railsconf.org/program/sessions#track-explain-it-like-i-m-five\\\">the talks in the Explain It Like I’m Five track</a>.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"open-source-maintenance\\\">Open Source Maintenance </h3>\\n\\n<p>“There is no harder maintenance case than ‘thousands of people already use this and the core team is distributed all over the world working at different companies,’” says Chelsea Troy, Mozilla Staff Software Engineer and the curator of the Open Source Maintenance Track.</p>\\n\\n<p>And yet according to Troy, most new developers are steered toward learning how to build something from scratch. “That’s almost never the case we’re talking about in the professional world,” she says.</p>\\n\\n<p>As an educator, Troy specializes in highlighting the areas of software engineering that are undervalued and yet essential in the day-to-day context for developers.</p>\\n\\n<p>Successful communication, versioning, and maintenance practices have been refined and standardized in popular open source projects out of necessity.</p>\\n\\n<p>However, Troy contends these skills are “useful for all (or most) dev teams to learn from and adopt—including closed-source, private, or proprietary software teams like the ones that send their people to RailsConf.”</p>\\n\\n<p>Common concerns like “testing for regressions, documentation, managing communities, and debugging” will be covered. Troy expects that the talks in this track will cater to a mixed-level audience.</p>\\n\\n<p>She’s looking forward to talks that offer an exciting spin on topics that too often go under-appreciated.</p>\\n\\n<p>Preview the lessons from open source in <a href=\\\"https://railsconf.org/program/sessions#track-open-source-maintenance\\\">the talks of the Open Source Maintenance track</a>.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"community-content\\\">Community Content</h3>\\n\\n<p>Rubyists interested in starting or elevating their content, be it blogs, podcasts, tutorials, meetups, books, games and more, should head straight for the Community Content track.</p>\\n\\n<p>Curated by Aisha Blake, director of developer relations for Pluralsight, the track will feature experienced creators of both digital and analogue content for the Ruby community.</p>\\n\\n<p>“One of the questions that I get pretty frequently is: how do I how do I get started?”, says Blake about her desire to curate the track.</p>\\n\\n<p>“You show up and you see the people who are giving the talks… hopefully, you learned something, or you’re moved by a story that they told. The exciting part about this track is that you can start to do those same things yourself. You can learn how to leverage your own story, your own work, your own interests to kind of elicit that same reaction in other people.”</p>\\n\\n<p>Blake is passionate about the power of effective communication to “not only educate, but to excite, inspire, engage” audiences, and is looking forward to using this space to uplift creators and educators in the Ruby community, as well as help new ones get started.</p>\\n\\n<p>She is excited about the “Give Your First Talk” workshop in this track, taking place in the morning on the last day of the conference. She encourages anyone who is even a little bit drawn to it to attend.</p>\\n\\n<p>“Take the opportunity. Like, try it out. Go talk it through with people who are kind of in the same boat with you, and don’t be afraid to to put yourself out there a little bit.”</p>\\n\\n<p>Learn ways you can start creating in <a href=\\\"https://railsconf.org/program/sessions#track-community-content\\\">the talks from the Community Content track</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>Whether you choose to go with a conference track, or freestyle RailsConf 2022, we hope this was helpful, and has you excited for the talks next week.

One such barrier is the sentiment that a formal degree in computer science is needed to be a great developer. I hope to show the flaws in this belief by demonstrating that even some of the topics in computer science that can be handy to know as developers are often not terribly relevant to the day-to-day problems that we encounter.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"what-do-you-want-people-to-take-away-from-it\\\">What do you want people to take away from it?</h3>\\n\\n<p>I hope that everyone will pick up some good tips and tricks to inform their software development strategies and to better understand some of the problems they encounter, but I also hope to show that a formal computer science education is just one valid path among infinitely many that lead to becoming a talented software developer.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"what-are-you-most-looking-forward-to-at-this-conference\\\">What are you most looking forward to at this conference?</h3>\\n\\n<p>I love learning and meeting smart and caring people; in my experience, the Ruby community is great at providing both.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"do-you-have-any-other-plans-in-portland-during-conference-week-that-youre-excited-about\\\">Do you have any other plans in Portland during conference week that you’re excited about?</h3>\\n\\n<p>I always love to hike and wander around parks and other green spaces, and it looks like Portland has a lot to offer.

In 2008 I was working in marketing and moonlighting as a PHP software developer. From the outside, I was continually inspired by how many problems good software could solve. However, programming is such an abstract art form. For that reason, it’s hard to get involved. But then, I saw David’s video “Build a blog in 15-minutes with Ruby on Rails,” and I was blown away.</p>\\n\\n<p>It was impressive that Rails could do what it does, but that the Ruby language was so elegant and intuitive - in Ruby talk, it was “developer-friendly.” I. Was. Hooked.</p>\\n\\n<p>Since that video, I got more involved. By 2011 I had started my first software development agency. Our company leaned on Ruby and Ruby on Rails because it’s effective and well supported. We didn’t need a degree. We didn’t need a certificate. We just needed a code editor. Within a few years, we built new careers for ourselves and found a path to a new life.</p>\\n\\n<p>I can thank many content creators for giving so much back to my professional life; however, nothing compares to Ruby and the Rails community. While I don’t appreciate all the strong opinions of David and others in the community, I can’t deny their impact on my life.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"whats-your-favorite-part-about-working-on-open-source-software\\\">What’s your favorite part about working on Open Source Software?</h3>\\n\\n<p>The community, and that it’s free. Money is a huge barrier for most projects. I understand why it’s important at some point, but for new people - going into anything - free matters.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"whats-your-least-favorite-part-about-working-on-oss\\\">What’s your least favorite part about working on OSS?</h3>\\n\\n<p>Nothing. It’s fantastic.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"what-inspired-you-to-give-this-talk\\\">What inspired you to give this talk?</h3>\\n\\n<p>The students of LEARN academy (code school in San Diego).</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"what-do-you-want-people-to-take-away-from-it\\\">What do you want people to take away from it?</h3>\\n\\n<p>Never forget that experimenting, breaking, and putting things back together is how the best discoveries are made. Don’t play it safe while you’re learning. Get messy.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"what-are-you-most-looking-forward-to-at-this-conference\\\">What are you most looking forward to at this conference?</h3>\\n\\n<p>Seeing people. I’m an extrovert.

I’ve made so many friends in this community, and seeing them sans the virtual background is very exciting after two years.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"do-you-have-any-other-plans-in-portland-during-conference-week-that-youre-excited-about\\\">Do you have any other plans in Portland during conference week that you’re excited about?</h3>\\n\\n<p>I grew up in Portland, so seeing the city I love again.

Read on for today’s speaker spotlight…</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"title-of-talk\\\">Title of Talk:</h3>\\n<p>Leveling Up from Planning to Production</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"speaker-thomas-countz\\\">Speaker: Thomas Countz</h3>\\n\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://draftin.com:443/images/80866?token=UDY7jrZI-ce4rRH2OE_TGVZ-DFkOQ5UApZlN1zkI8u4y8Li65oZFg2Dp482l0CY7xFybN25SzsEieA8Q8Xjeoeg\\\" alt=\\\"headshot - Thomas Countz.JPG\\\" /></p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"how-did-you-get-into-ruby\\\">How Did you get into Ruby?</h3>\\n\\n<p>I was learning how to code from books and resources on the internet. Originally, I was really into Python because I enjoyed the “There should be one– and preferably only one –obvious way to do it” ethos codified in the Zen of Python (link: https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/). Python felt learnable to me.</p>\\n\\n<p>Then, I found a resource called The Odin Project (link: https://www.theodinproject.com/) that vibed with the way that I enjoyed learning. It used a language called “Ruby” and taught a framework called “Ruby on Rails,” and that’s when I discovered web development, which seemed like a great way to enter the software engineering industry!</p>\\n\\n<p>As luck would have it, at the same time of discovering this thing called “Ruby,” I was working at a coffee shop where a regular customer would come in and work. I got a peek at their screen one day and… WHAT?! “IS THAT RUBY?!” Sure enough, it was!</p>\\n\\n<p>Not only was it Ruby, but the woman writing it ended up becoming my best friend and mentor. The story of “how I got into Ruby,” cannot be separated from, “how did you meet your best friend Christine,” because meeting Christine is the story of Ruby. Rubyists support each other, they teach, they get excited about expanding the community, they create resources, give back, and on top of it all, they’re wicked smart.</p>\\n\\n<p>Having her invest and believe in me is the inciting incident that lead me to where I am today.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"whats-your-favorite-part-about-working-on-open-source-software\\\">What’s your favorite part about working on Open Source Software?</h3>\\n\\n<p>The reach, impact, and community. Working on OSS, rather than only using it, means you are on the forefront of solving issues that can have a huge impact! I love solving problems and it seems like the larger the impact, the more satisfying it is for me to contribute.</p>\\n\\n<p>That being said, it’s not something I’ve done a lot of. Those who are consistent contributors are also often great community leaders. What motivates me most to becoming a contributor means giving back to the community which has given me so much!</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"whats-your-least-favorite-part-about-working-on-oss\\\">What’s your least favorite part about working on OSS?</h3>\\n\\n<p>The barrier to entry. I don’t know that there’s a silver bullet to this; maintainers can invest A LOT into getting people onboarded to contributing, but going from OSS user to OSS contributor can feel like a wide chasm.</p>\\n\\n<p>That being said, because it’s my “least favorite part,” I’m fiercely interested in finding out how to make it easier for folks to get started!</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"what-inspired-you-to-give-this-talk\\\">What inspired you to give this talk?</h3>\\n\\n<p>As I became more senior, I felt the structures around me beginning to fall down. As a junior, those “structures,” were patterns of work that I’d been taught to use in order to navigate small tasks: write tests, ask to pair, read about code smells, develop good PR hygiene…</p>\\n\\n<p>As a senior, it seemed like there were no structures—no guidelines—for approaching bigger responsibilities. Everyone kind of just figured it out for themselves. How do we communicate about larger and larger systems? How do we look at a business priority and systematically know how to approach it from an engineering perspective? How do we become responsible for work that can span months, not just days?</p>\\n\\n<p>I had to get more comfortable not knowing what I was doing. Getting good at not knowing sounds like it’s easy, but it’s actually a huge responsibility! You have to admit to what you don’t know and make a plan for how you’ll reduce those unknowns over time. As I had chats with colleagues about this, it turned out that lots of them felt this same dissonance.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"what-do-you-want-people-to-take-away-from-it\\\">What do you want people to take away from it?</h3>\\n\\n<p>I hope that people will take away some practical examples of how to lean into unknowns, rather than shy away from them. Not only is it okay not to know something, it’s our job to recognize gaps in our knowledge and to develop a strategy for navigating them in order to get our work done.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"what-are-you-most-looking-forward-to-at-this-conference\\\">What are you most looking forward to at this conference?</h3>\\n\\n<p>I was really looking forward to maybe making a friend or two… As it turned out, I’d made dozens! Everyone at RailsConf was so eager to learn from each other. It was truly inspiring. I’m still riding the wave of encouragement and inspiration!</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"did-you-do-anything-fun-in-portland-during-conference-week\\\">Did you do anything fun in Portland during conference week?</h3>\\n\\n<p>While I was in Portland, I went to arcades and coffee shops and diners and bars… it was never ending, but I wouldn’t have had it any other way.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"thank-you-thomas-for-sharing-a-bit-of-your-story-see-you-at-railsconf2022-home-edition\\\">Thank you, Thomas, for sharing a bit of your story.

Whether you’ve been preparing for this moment all year, or last month’s CFP announcement illuminated a gem ;-D of inspiration in you, now’s the time to crack your knuckles, take to the keyboard, put your best ideas forward in the CFP app and ship it.</p>\\n\\n<p>If you’re on the fence about submitting a proposal, you’ve come to the right place. We’re here to demystify the process, alleviate your concerns and share some words of wisdom from a few recent RubyConf speakers who are glad they went for it! Without further ado, here are your 5 reasons to turn that idea into RubyConf 2022 talk:</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"youll-be-supported-the-whole-way-through\\\">1. You’ll be supported the whole way through</h2>\\n\\n<p>Turning your ideas into a conference talk proposal that is clear, fits this year’s conference themes and impresses the program committee can feel like a daunting task. Luckily, you don’t have to start from a blank slate. In fact, former program committee member Noel Rappin and veteran speaker Sarah Mei have created some of our favorite guides to help you <a href=\\\"https://noelrappin.com/blog/2014/01/conference-prompts-or-how-to-submit-proposals-and-influence-people/\\\">develop your ideas into a proposal</a>, and <a href=\\\"http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2014/04/07/what-your-conference-proposal-is-missing/\\\">elevate that proposal</a> to make it engaging and polished.</p>\\n\\n<p>If you’re still feeling lost or would like some feedback on your work so far, another Ruby veteran Kevin Murphy has kindly offered his <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/kevin_j_m/status/1552744656307458048\\\">support</a> and has even shared examples of his <a href=\\\"https://kevinjmurphy.com/posts/sharing-past-conference-proposals/\\\">successful proposals</a> to spark your imagination.</p>\\n\\n<p>Maybe you have everything you need for a RubyConf talk proposal, but you’re nervous about what happens if your talk gets selected and you have to actually, you know, talk!</p>\\n\\n<p>We have your back. Whether you’ve never given a conference talk, never presented at RubyConf specifically or simply are not sure how to best explain your particular topic, once you are selected you have the option to be paired with a speaker mentor who can help you prepare your talk.</p>\\n\\n<p>If you want to get a jump start on the process, many former speakers have shared their experiences getting to the RubyConf stage too, including RubyConf 2021 speaker Stefanni Brasil who created a fun and helpful <a href=\\\"https://www.hexdevs.com/posts/public-speaking-tips-for-software-developers/\\\">step-by-step guide</a> to creating and delivering a technical talk.</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"no-really--we-got-you-heres-some-more-topic-inspiration\\\">2. No, really — we got you! Here’s some more topic inspiration</h2>\\n\\n<p>Choosing to submit a talk to be included in a <a href=\\\"https://cfp.rubycentral.org/events/rubyconf-2022\\\">conference track</a> is a great way to narrow down your choices if you’re feeling overwhelmed by this step in the submission process. Some of our most inclusive tracks are “Bringing Your Backgrounds With You” and “Hidden Gems.” Casey Watts and Elayne Juten, the program committee members who created these tracks, respectively, shared their personal reasons to submit a talk to these tracks.</p>\\n\\n<p>“Teams are stronger when you can bring your full self to work, and our conference is stronger when our speakers can bring their full selves. This theme is close to the heart of the Ruby community,” said Watts. “What unique perspectives do you bring to the community and the workplace? We’d love to hear about them!”</p>\\n\\n<p>Juten invites potential speakers to share about a particular gem (or gems) from new angles: “What gems do you love to use? Have you explored the internals of a gem? We would love to hear from you!”</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"you-may-help-invite-new-faces-to-the-table\\\">3. You may help invite new faces to the table</h2>\\n\\n<p>It’s no secret that tech conferences, like the field itself, can be very homogenous…i.e. white and men dominated, with not much variety in class representation. We fully recognize this and it’s why we created the <a href=\\\"https://rubycentral.org/scholarships\\\">Opportunity Scholarship program</a> and why we are happy to partner with <a href=\\\"https://www.wnb-rb.dev/\\\">WNB.rb</a> to support RubyConf Mini. It’s also why if you feel like representation has been an important part of your tech career, you can consider applying to speak a chance to welcome and build community with other Rubyists looking for someone like you.</p>\\n\\n<p>That’s what inspired Stefanni Brasil, co-founder and educator at hexdevs, to submit her talk <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sfyVxjvew0\\\">“Perceptual Learning == More Ruby Experts?”</a> at RubyConf 2021. “I wanted to see more people like me speaking at technical conferences. I’m a second-language English speaker and immigrant,” she said. Brasil also tapped into the Ruby community for support. “I collaborated with other developers from WNB.rb and we supported each other during this process. It made a total difference in feeling more confident with submitting a proposal.”</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"youll-have-a-chance-for-your-skills-to-shine\\\">4. You’ll have a chance for your skills to shine</h2>\\n\\n<p>One of the common themes former speakers shared about speaking at their first RubyConf is that it was a validating highlight in their professional careers. From joining a roster of Rubyists who have made great contributions to the community, to connecting with potential employers who are actively hiring, “putting yourself out there” as a speaker is a wonderful way to confirm your Ruby expertise.</p>\\n\\n<p>“It was a shift to feeling like I have something to contribute, and that I’m able to be part of this community beyond just observing it,” said Scott Moore, Senior Software Engineer at Doximity. After he presented his workshop <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC0fO7Ggzyg\\\">“All comments must be haiku! Custom linting with RuboCop”</a> at RubyConf 2021, “One of the attendees told me they implemented the concept from the workshop at their day job,” he said. “Being able to help someone like that in such an immediate way was hugely rewarding.”</p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"youll-experience-rubyconf-magic-in-a-new-way\\\">5. You’ll experience RubyConf magic in a new way</h2>\\n\\n<p>If you’ve ever attended a RubyConf you’re likely familiar with the special environment created when the all of the ideas, innovation, and problem solving are focused on Ruby. “Often the technologies around web development are all mixed together with Ruby,” said Principal Software Engineer, Kyle d’Oliveira who gave a talk at RubyConf 2021 titled <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LitTV2k_X34\\\">“The mindset of debugging.”</a></p>\\n\\n<p>“It is really inspiring to see what can be done with Ruby on its own. You can learn neat things about the language itself, or new ways to apply it that you may not have thought about before.”</p>\\n\\n<p>As a speaker, you have the opportunity be a part of shaping this experience for fellow Rubyists by adding your unique perspective to the conversations, and possibly changing the way they look at the language forever.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"a-bonus\\\">5a. Bonus</h3>\\n\\n<p>For those of you who can and do sign up to speak in Houston or Providence, this will be doubly felt. “I find being present in-person is the difference between listening to a conference vs participating in a conference,” shared d’Oliveira. “It’s easier to connect with people, randomly meeting someone, join hallway conversations, etc.” added Brasil.  </p>\\n\\n<h2 id=\\\"a-few-final-thoughts\\\">A few final thoughts</h2>\\n\\n<p>The bottom line is, you don’t need to feel completely ready to create a wonderful conference proposal and deliver a great talk. All you need is the seed of an idea and the Ruby community will support you the rest of the way. We’ll leave you with a final word of encouragement from one of our featured former speakers:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>“Earlier in my career, I didn’t think it was useful to speak at a conference because I didn’t think I had anything novel, interesting, or even useful to say. I look back and I realize just how wrong I was. Everyone has something valuable to talk about that could be beneficial to others and the more we push to share as part of the Ruby community, the better we can all become.”  </p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>–Kyle d’Oliveira</p>\\n\\n<p>We hope this post has helped all of you CFP fence-sitters to take the leap!

Read on for their expert wisdom!</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"oh-youre-a-fan-of-ruby-name-every-gem-or-imaginary-conference-conversations\\\">Oh You’re a Fan of Ruby? Name Every Gem! (Or, Imaginary Conference Conversations)</h3>\\n\\n<p>In the days and hours leading up to RubyConf you may be feeling excitement or nervousness — or anything in between. These feelings can be intensified by preconceived notions about what a tech conferences is like. It’s easy to build up a picture of worst case scenarios when you don’t know exactly what you’ll be walking into. The Scholars and Guides we interviewed shared their biggest worries going into their first Ruby Central and tech conferences, and we have a feeling you’ll be able to relate.</p>\\n\\n<p>“As a junior new to the entire industry I suspected that I would be quizzed with leetcode questions or would otherwise find myself in conversations that would require perfect knowledge of sorting algorithms or some new, yet obscure, technology,” shared Dana Weiss, a Software Engineer and former Scholar. “I’m a bit of an introvert so I was just hoping to make it through unscathed.”</p>\\n\\n<p>Ella Xu, a Software Engineer at Hack Club; and Caitlin Henry, Ruby on Rails Software Engineer, both wondered if the professional connections they were seeking would be easy to make.</p>\\n\\n<p>“I thought there would be existing social circles, or cliques, of people that knew each other before the conference,” Xu shared. “I was most nervous about how overwhelming navigating the conference would be, and about how easy it would be to connect with and meet others,” said Henry.</p>\\n\\n<p>For one Guide, a version of these fears played out. John Sawers, a speaker, entrepreneur and engineering manager who currently helps coordinate Ruby Central’s Opportunity Scholars and Guides Program, recalled the overwhelming experience of his first tech conference.</p>\\n\\n<p>“It was easy enough to go to sessions, but actually talking to the other attendees was very hard,” he said. “I think I only talked to one person, and he was hyping his JS library.”</p>\\n\\n<p>Sawers said he left the conference feeling like he didn’t get the full experience, saying he “felt pretty isolated.”</p>\\n\\n<p>So, how can you shift your focus from your fears to experiencing RubyConf2022 to the fullest?</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"hacking-pre-conference-jitters-get-by-with-a-little-help-from-your-conference-friends\\\">Hacking Pre-conference Jitters: Get By With A Little Help From Your Conference Friends</h3>\\n\\n<p>Well first, it might help to know that there will be no coding pop quizzes (as Weiss was happy to find out) – and if anyone tries to give you one, you’re free to walk away!</p>\\n\\n<p>Next, you can start by slowing tapping into the energy of the conference. Being around a few fellow conference goers before fully immersing yourself in the day’s activities might help you ease into the event.</p>\\n\\n<p>Henry’s nerves began to transform, “once I checked into the hotel the day before the conference started,” they said. “I was more excited than nervous as I felt the pre-conference buzz of the hotel lobby and bar.”</p>\\n\\n<p>Sawers intentionally changed his approach to navigating conferences after his first go-around. “My experience didn’t change until my social context changed,” he said. He attended his first RailsConf with his team and found that “it was so much easier to manage, more fun, and I could rely on more outgoing members of the team to start conversations or find fun things to do.”</p>\\n\\n<p>Kinsey Durham Grace, another Scholars and Guides coordinator, and Infrastructure Engineer at GitHub, similarly reflected that having a group to navigate the conference with made all the difference. In her case, it was the Scholars and Guides program. As a speaker, she joined her first conference as a Guide.</p>\\n\\n<p>After that, “it became an essential part of my conference experience,” she said. “It is where I can feel comfortable in a smaller group and where I have met my best friends in the community.”</p>\\n\\n<p>Sawers, too, says he now has “conference friends” he looks forward to connecting with after having attended several Ruby- and Rails- Confs. “I collected more every year,” he added.</p>\\n\\n<p>In fact, all of the Scholars and Guides agreed that the best way to navigate the conference and reduce your fears was to focus on making connections.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"the-social-butterfly-effect-making-meaningful-connections\\\">The Social Butterfly Effect: Making Meaningful Connections</h3>\\n\\n<p>You never know the ripple effect one friendly RubyConf conversation could have on your life – or at the very least, your day. So what’s the best way to get started? The Scholars and Guides we interviewed suggested a few different approaches.  </p>\\n\\n<p>“One of the greatest things was the Slack channel,” shared Henry. “This was a great place to connect, stay in touch with, and meet other attendees. From threads about making lunch/dinner plans in Portland, to discussing our favorite talks, to threads for the LGBTQ Rails community to connect, the Slack channel had something for everyone!”</p>\\n\\n<p>As an attendee you’ll receive access the RubyConf2022 conference channel a week before the event. The Scholars and Guides program also has its own Slack channels, to support members and connect them throughout the conference.</p>\\n\\n<p>Xu shared her strategy for meeting conference goers on site: “Don’t try to go to every talk/workshop/event; spend time meeting other conference attendees in the hallways and exhibition hall,” she advised.</p>\\n\\n<p>Another good place to start is approaching a speaker after a session you enjoy — they are very likely to be open to a conversation. “They love it (I’m a speaker, so I know),” assured Sawers. “They’ll always be down at the front after their talk, so go say hi.”</p>\\n\\n<p>On the other hand, conference goers may strike up a conversation with you – in that case, you get to skip the hard part. As long as you’re safe and feeling up for it, take a chance to get to know them. “Say yes to all the opportunities presented!” prompted Weiss. It could be the beginning of a beautiful conference friendship!</p>\\n\\n<p>When it comes to working up the courage to start a conversation, putting yourself in the right mindset can start with acknowledging that it’s normal to feel a little uncomfortable. “Likely you’re out of your comfort zone just being there,” said Sawers. “Embrace that and make your self even less comfortable by talking to as many people as you can.”</p>\\n\\n<p>All of the Scholars and Guides agreed that overcoming this will be well worth it. As Henry shared, “the biggest thing you’ll take away, other than the exposure and knowledge gained, are those new relationships!”</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"more-words-of-wisdom\\\">More Words of Wisdom</h3>\\n\\n<p>Aside from making connections, the Scholars and Guides interviewed offered a few more pieces of guidance to help first time conference goers make the most of RubyConf2022.</p>\\n\\n<p>“Be sure to set goals before the conference,” Durham Grace suggested. For example going into her first conference Xu intended “to learn about Rails features I didn’t know about before and be able to use that knowledge to make a meaningful contribution to an open source Rails app” and “to meet other developers and learn about their work.”</p>\\n\\n<p>It can also be as simple as looking at the conference schedule ahead of time, as Henry did “in great detail. I knew that there were going to be some amazing talks to attend,” they shared.</p>\\n\\n<p>Additionally, as a conference newcomer, whether or not you are in the Scholars and Guides program, you are welcome to request a conference Guide. “If we have bandwidth, we will pair first time conference attendees with a Guide,” shared Durham Grace.</p>\\n\\n<p>Finally, mentally prepare yourself to be present and have a great time! “It’s going to be intense and very tiring,” said Henry. “Have fun and get as much out of the conference as you can!” encouraged Durham Grace. “Soak it all up!”  Added Henry.</p>\\n\\n<h3 id=\\\"final-dispatches-from-the-scholars-and-guides-program\\\">Final Dispatches From The Scholars and Guides Program</h3>\\n\\n<p>If any of this is making you consider signing up for the Scholars and Guides program in the future (applications are closed for RubyConf2022 and the Scholar/Guide pairings have been <a href=\\\"https://rubyconf.org/scholarships#SG22\\\">announced</a>!), here are some encouraging words from the past participants, that may help push you past your comfort zone to sign up!</p>\\n\\n<p>“There was so much great information that the guides shared with us Scholars, and it was a great way to connect with others pre-conference. This helped to ease my nerves as I could ask as many questions as I wanted leading up to the conference,” said Henry.</p>\\n\\n<p>“It was helpful to talk to and walk around with other Scholars and Guides,” said Xu. She said this is what helped her the most with her pre-conference nerves.</p>\\n\\n<p>“She was able to introduce me to her friends and point me to good speakers so I didn’t miss any good talks,” said Weiss of her guide. I immediately had folks to eat lunch with and make dinner plans with, so I already felt like a part of the community.”</p>\\n\\n<p>“I can think of a lot of Scholars who got their first jobs at RailsConf and these are exactly the people we want to see getting a solid foothold in tech,” said Sawers.</p>\\n\\n<p>“It’s amazing how many Guides that have been Scholars before come back each year,” said Durham Grace. Hearing the stories of how the program helped them change their lives is so incredible to hear. I have met so many incredible people through the program!”</p>\\n\\n<p>We hope this advice was helpful and has helped set the tone for RubyConf2022.
