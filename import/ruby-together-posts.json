There are now over 100,000 gems, and those gems have over a million versions.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"With those million versions comes a completely unprecedented number of downloads. In the years from 2003 to the end of 2014, we tracked roughly 2 billion gem downloads. That’s 2 billion downloads over more than ten years. Then, in 2015 alone (just one year!) we served 4 billion gem downloads.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"That is an \"],[0,[1],1,\"extremely\"],[0,[],0,\" steep increase. If we were a startup, we’d have great graphs to show VCs and convince them to give us money. But we’re not a startup. Before Ruby Together, all of RubyGems.org was maintained for free by volunteers. That’s a problem, because at the same time that usage has been increasing exponentially, volunteer help hasn’t been increasing.\"]]],[1,\"h3\",[[0,[],0,\"the volunteer crisis\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Most people don’t realize this, but the RubyGems.org team is incredibly small. It’s never had more than four people on it, and most often has only had two. The Bundler team is even smaller—it’s never had more than two people working on it consistently, and often only one.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"None of those team members were ever paid for their work.

This isn’t super surprising, since almost every Ruby developer and company depends on RubyGems.org in order to be able to do their work.

None of them were already familiar with how the servers worked, and helping them get up to speed would have slowed down the recovery efforts.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"The worst part, though, is that once RubyGems.org was back up… all of those volunteers disappeared. None of them were wiling to get up to speed and help out when there wasn’t an emergency.

But companies sometimes hire Ruby developers specifically to work on open source.

In \"],[0,[5],1,\"Bundler 1.10\"],[0,[],0,\", we added the \"],[0,[3],1,\"lock\"],[0,[],0,\" command, optional groups, conditional groups, and the ability to mute post-install messages per gem. (Finally, it’s possible to never be told “You must HTTParty hard” again!) In \"],[0,[6],1,\"Bundler 1.11\"],[0,[],0,\", we dramatically improved error messages both in general and when the Gemfile cannot be resolved. In \"],[0,[7],1,\"Bundler 1.12\"],[0,[],0,\", we finished a 3-year-long project and started using a new gem metadata file format that allows us to finally stop sending every user information about every gem every time they install. We also increased the speed of \"],[0,[3],1,\"bundle exec\"],[0,[],0,\" and added support for locking and updating the Ruby version. In \"],[0,[8],1,\"Bundler 1.13\"],[0,[],0,\", we added support for gems with \"],[0,[3],1,\"required_ruby_version\"],[0,[],0,\" for Gemfiles that declare their \"],[0,[3],1,\"ruby\"],[0,[],0,\" version, added the \"],[0,[3],1,\"doctor\"],[0,[],0,\" command to fix broken compiled gems, and added the ability to add and remove platforms you want Bundler to resolve for.

We’ve even ported the entire Bundler API Sinatra app into the RubyGems.org Rails app. Someday very soon, we’ll only have one platform to keep operational. That’s a big win, giving us more reliability while requiring us to do less work. We also switched to using the \"],[0,[17],1,\"Fastly CDN\"],[0,[],0,\" for gem downloads, and we have ever so slowly reworked the entire architecture of RubyGems.org so that every page can be served from Fastly’s closest data center instead of from Amazon’s US-West region.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"On top of all of that proactive maintenance, we have paid developers to take on incident response.

You can run one on your local laptop to avoid downloading gems multiple times. You can run one in your office to speed up installing the gems your application needs. Or you can run one in your datacenter, and install gems across all your server from a local source.

I also started addressing some issues surfaced by the Bundler 2 release, specifically about being too picky about the Bundler version a specific application should run. Currently, Bundler will raise if the version in the BUNDLED WITH section of the lock file doesn’t match the running version.

On the other hand, Ethical Source tries to level the playing field between the creator community and the companies that adopt their work. “It has to be a symbiotic relationship in order to be fair,” says Ehmke.

When the security issue was discovered everyone on the team was balancing work obligations.

We had to create completely new servers from scratch. We also had to download and verify every single one of the hundreds of thousands of .gem files, to make sure the hacker hadn’t replaced any of them while they had access. It felt like all the work we had done up until that point was a huge waste – and also showed us what a massive risk not having paid developers maintaining our systems could be.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"After the incident, André, who was working on Bundler at the time, began to focus his efforts on finding funding to pay developers working on Bundler and RubyGems.
